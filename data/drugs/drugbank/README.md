# DrugBank Data

This folder is **optional**. The application uses built-in drug data from `knowledge_base/drugbank_loader.py`.

## If you want to download full DrugBank data:

1. Go to https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest
2. Create a free academic account
3. Download the full database XML or CSV files
4. Extract here

## Expected files (optional):
- `drugbank_full_database.xml` - Full database
- `drug_interactions.csv` - Interaction data
- `drug_products.csv` - Product information

## Note:
The app works without these files using built-in data for common medications.
