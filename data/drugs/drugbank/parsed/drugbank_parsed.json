    "description": "Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name pr",

    "description": "Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. Chlorthalidone improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure.[A176324]\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension.[A173863] In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590].[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999]. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.[A176330]",
    "indication": "Chlorthalidone is indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy.\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone has also been found useful in edema due to various forms of renal dysfunction, such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, and chronic renal failure.",

By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, Chlorthalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume which therefore requires decreased cardiac output and overall lowers blood pressure.[A176324] Chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathway",

    "name": "Lorazepam",
    "description": "Lorazepam is a short-acting and rapidly cleared benzodiazepine used commonly as a sedative and anxiolytic.[A957] It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.[L5095]",
    "indication": "Lorazepam is FDA-approved for the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms related to anxiety disorders and anxiety associated with depressive symptoms such as anxiety-associated insomnia. It is as well used as an anesthesia premedication in adults to relieve anxiety or to produce sedation/amnesia and for the treatment of status epilepticus.[T385]\r\n\r\nSome off-label indications of lorazepam include rapid tranquilization of an agitated patient, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, insomnia, panic disorder, delirium, chemotherapy-associated anticipatory nausea and vomiting, and psychogenic catatonia.[T385]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "The effect of lorazepam in GABA-A receptors produces an increase in the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel. However, for its effect to generate, the neurotransmitter is required.[A5415] The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam are thought to be related to the binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels in which the sustained repetitive firing gets limited by the slow recovery of sodium channels due to the benzodiazepine effect.[A1240]\r\n\r\nThe effect of lorazepam seems to be very compartmental which was observed with a different generation of sleepiness and a dizziness effect.[A173920]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Lorazepam allosterically binds on the benzodiazepine receptors in the post-synaptic GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel in different sites of the central nervous system (CNS). This binding will result in an increase on the GABA inhibitory effects which is translated as an increase in the flow of chloride ions into the cell causing hyperpolarization and stabilization of the cellular plasma membrane.[T385]\r\n\r\nAccording to the binding site of lorazepam, we can observe different activities as the binding in the amygdala is known to help mainly in anxiety disorders while the binding in the cerebral cortex helps in seizure disorders.[T385]",
    "toxicity": "The LD50 observed by oral administration in a mouse is of 1850 mg/kg.[L6403] When an overdose administration is registered, signs of CNS and respiratory depression are rapidly observed. An overdose stage can result in profound sedation, deep respiratory depression, coma, and death.[T385] When overdose is observed, it is recommended to administer emergency symptomatic medical support with attention to produce an increase in lorazepam elimination.[T388]\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of carcinogenicity n",
    "metabolism": "Lorazepam is hepatically metabolized by CYP450 isoenzymes and extensively conjugated to the 3-0-phenolic glucuronide.[T385] This is an inactive metabolite and is eliminated mainly by the kidneys.",
    "absorption": "Readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 90% when given orally. When intramuscularly administered a dose of 4 mg, lorazepam is completely and rapidly absorbed and achieves a maximal serum concentration of 48 ng/ml in 15-30 minutes. When administered orally, the time to attained maximum concentration is observed to be of 2 hours.[T385]",
    "half_life": "When administered parentally, the registered half-life of lorazepam is of 14 hours.[T385] Following the administration of 1 mg of lorazepam in healthy adult male volunteers and using a multi-doses equation based on a one-compartment model, the average elimination half-life of lorazepam was estimated to be 11 hours and 8 hours for sublingual and oral doses respectively.[A251115] The absorption half-life was calculated to be 55 minutes for oral doses and 15 minutes for sublingual doses.[A251115]",
    "protein_binding": "Reports indicate that 85% of lorazepam administered dose is protein bound.[T388]",
    "route_of_elimination": "When a single 2 mg oral dose is given to healthy subjects, 88% of the administered dose is recovered in urine and 7% was recovered in feces. From the excreted dose in urine, the major form is the glucuronide version that represents 74% while only 0.3% of the dose is recovered as unchanged lorazepam.",

    "description": "First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] \r\n\r\nGlimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commo",
    "indication": "Glimepiride is indicated for the management of type 2 diabetes in adults as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control as monotherapy. \r\n\r\nIt may also be indicated for use in combination with metformin or insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycemic (a drug used to lower blood sugar levels) agent alone.[L10322]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels. A multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of glimepiride (1–8 mg) as monotherapy titrated over 10 weeks compared with placebo in T2DM subjects who were not controlled by diet alone.[A177703] In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo.[A177703] In another randomized study comprising of patients with T2DM receiving either placebo or one of the three doses (1, 4, or 8 mg) of glimepiride during a 14-week study period, all glimepiride regimens significantly reduced FPG, PPG, and HbA1c values (P < 0.001) compared to placebo by the end of the study period.[A177703] T",
    "mechanism_of_action": "ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells that are gated by intracellular ATP and ADP. The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization ",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD50 value in rats is > 10000 mg/kg.[MSDS] The intraperitoneal LD50 value in rats is reported to be 3950 mg/kg [MSDS]. Although glimepiride is reported to have fewer risks of hypoglycemia compared to other sulfonylureas such as glyburide, overdosage of glimepiride may result in severe hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment may occur. This can be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose. Continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necess",
    "metabolism": "Glimepiride is reported to undergo hepatic metabolism. Following either an intravenous or oral dose, glimepiride undergoes oxidative biotransformation mediated by CYP2C9 enzyme to form a major metabolite, cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl derivative (M1), that is pharmacologically active. M1 can be further metabolized to the inactive metabolite carboxyl derivative (M2) by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M1 retained approximately one third of the pharmacologic activity of its parent in an animal model, ",
    "absorption": "Glimepiride is completely absorbed after oral administration within 1 hour of administration with a linear pharmacokinetics profile.[A177703] Following administration of a single oral dose of glimepiride in healthy subjects and with multiple oral doses with type 2 diabetes, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were reached after 2 to 3 hours post-dose.[L10319] Accumulation does not occur after multiple doses.[A177703] When glimepiride was given with meals, the time to reach Cmax was increased b",

    "description": "Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.[A173995] It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.[A187190] Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively characterized, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.[A187190,L7066] Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).[L1006,L7066] It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.[A31161]",
    "indication": "Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.[L7066]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Although the structure of pregabalin is similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind to GABA receptors.[A31163,A187190] Instead, it binds the alpha2-delta subunit of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system.[A31163,A187190] Pregabalin does not modulate dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, opiate receptors, sodium channels or cyclooxygenase activity.[A187190]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models.[L7066]  \r\n\r\nBy binding presynaptically to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, pregabalin modulates the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate, substance-P, norepinephrine, and calcitonin gene related peptide.[A31163] In addition, pregabalin prevents the alpha2-delta subunit from being trafficked from the dorsal root ganglia to the spinal dorsal horn, which may also contribute to the mechanism of action.[A36628] \r\n\r\nAlthough pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors.[A31165]",
    "toxicity": "In a systematic review that included 38 randomized controlled trials, there were 20 identified adverse effects that were significantly associated with pregabalin, most of which involve the central nervous system and cognition.  The identified adverse effects include vertigo, dizziness, balance disorder, incoordination, ataxia, blurred vision, diplopia, amblyopia, somnolence, confusional state, tremor, disturbance in attention, abnormal thinking, asthenia, fatigue, euphoria, edema, peripheral ede",
    "metabolism": "Less than 2% of pregabalin is metabolized and it is excreted virtually unchanged in the urine.[A31165,L7066]",
    "absorption": "After oral dosing administered in the fasted state, pregabalin absorption is rapid, and extensive.[A31165] Pregabalin oral bioavailability is reported to be ≥90% regardless of the dose.[A31165] Cmax is attained within 1.5 hours after single or multiple doses, and steady state is attained within 24-48 hours with repeated administration.[A31165,L7066] Both Cmax and AUC appear to be dose proportional.[A31165]\r\n\r\nFood decreases the rate of pregabalin absorption and as a result, lowers the Cmax by an",

    "route_of_elimination": "Pregabalin is almost exclusively eliminated in the urine.[A187093,A187096]\r\n\r\nFurther, based on preclinical studies, pregabalin does not appear to undergo racemization to the R enantiomer in the body.[A31168]",

    "description": "Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker commonly employed as the succinate and tartrate derivatives depending if the formulation is designed to be of immediate release or extended release.[A175159, L5530] The possibility of the generation of these formulations comes from the lower systemic bioavailability of the succinate derivative.[T274] To this date, it is one of the preferred beta-blockers in general clinical guidelines and it is widely prescribed in the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the US.[A175162] Metoprolol was developed since 1969 by US Pharmaceutical Holdings I and FDA approved in 1978.[L5527]",
    "indication": "Metoprolol is indicated for the treatment of angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and hypertension.[A175141,L36065,L45553]\r\n\r\nSome off-label uses of metoprolol include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm.[A175141]\r\n\r\nAll the indications of metoprolol are part of cardiovascular diseases. These conditions correspond to a number of diseases that involve the function of the heart and blood vessels. The underlying causes of these conditions are variable and can be due to genetic disposition, lifestyle decisions such as smoking, obesity, diet, and lack of exercise, and comorbidity with other conditions such as diabetes. The cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death on a global scale.[L5533]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Administration of metoprolol in normal subjects is widely reported to produce a dose-dependent reduction on heart rate and cardiac output.[A175141] This effect is generated due to a decreased cardiac excitability, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen demand.[T76] In the case of arrhythmias, metoprolol produces its effect by reducing the slope of the pacemaker potential as well as suppressing the rate of atrioventricular conduction.[T451]\r\n\r\nThe Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) trial showed a significant improvement in sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction when patients were given with metoprolol as compared with diuretics. As well, in clinical trials performed in 1990, metoprolol reduces mortality and re-infarction in 17% of the individuals when administered chronically after an episode of myocardial infarction.[A175141]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Metoprolol is a beta-1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor specific to cardiac cells with negligible effect on beta-2 receptors. This inhibition decreases cardiac output by producing negative chronotropic and inotropic effects without presenting activity towards membrane stabilization nor intrinsic sympathomimetics.[A175141]",
    "toxicity": "Oral administration of metoprolol to rats presents an LD50 in the range of 3090 to 4670 mg/kg. Cases of overdose have reported bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and cardiac failure. In the case of an overdose, gastric lavage is recommended followed by specific treatment according to symptoms.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nMetoprolol is not reported to be carcinogenic nor mutagenic nor to impair fertility. The only event registered is the increase of macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and slight biliary hype",
    "metabolism": "Metoprolol goes through significant first-pass hepatic metabolism which covers around 50% of the administered dose.[A175141] The metabolism of metoprolol is mainly driven by the activity of CYP2D6[A175162] and to a lesser extent due to the activity of CYP3A4. The metabolism of metoprolol is mainly represented by reactions of hydroxylation and O-demethylation.[L5530]",
    "absorption": "When metoprolol is administered orally, it is almost completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.[A175141] The maximum serum concentration is achieved 20 min after intravenous administration and 1-2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability of metoprolol is of 100% when administered intravenously and when administered orally it presents about 50% for the tartrate derivative and 40% for the succinate derivative.[T274]\r\n\r\nThe absorption of metoprolol in the form of the tartrate de",

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. \r\n\r\nOlmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] \r\n\r\nBy comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme.

Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline.

It is commonly described as an \"insulin sensitizer\", leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels.[A176173] Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss, making it an effective choice for obese patients type II diabetes.[A36559]\r\n\r\nMetformin was first approved in Canada in 1972,[A36552] and received subsequent FDA approval in the US in 1995.[L12207]",

    "pharmacodynamics": "**General effects**\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]\r\n\r\nMetformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]\r\n\r\n**Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**\r\n\r\nHbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients.

    "mechanism_of_action": "Metformin's mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.\r\n\r\nAfter ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells).

    "description": "Ipratropium is a quaternary ammonium derivative of [atropine][A176957] that acts as an anticholinergic agent.[A176939] It is commonly administered through inhalation which allows producing a local effect without presenting a significant systemic absorption.[A176957]\r\n\r\nIpratropium as a therapeutic agent was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and its first monotherapy product was FDA approved in 1986, while the combination product of ipratropium and [albuterol] was approved in 1996.[L5894, L5891]",
    "indication": "Inhaled ipratropium is indicated in combination with inhaled beta-agonist systemic corticosteroids for the management of severe exacerbations of asthma flares requiring treatment.[A176939]\r\n\r\nAsthma exacerbations are characterized by a progressive increase in one or more of asthma symptoms accompanied by a decrease in expiratory flow.[L5900]\r\n\r\nAs a single agent, ipratropium was indicated for the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea associated with the common cold or seasonal allergic rhinitis for patients 5 years or older. It does not alleviate nasal congestion nor sneezing.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nRhinorrhea refers to recurrent or chronic watery nasal discharge. This condition is debilitating and its pathogenesis and etiology is complex and not very well understood presenting very substantial cost burden.[L5903]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ipratropium is indicated as a bronchodilator for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including chronic bronchitis a",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Ipratropium is a short-acting agent that inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system at the level of the airway which then produces bronchodilatation. The effect of this agent starts after 1-2 hours and it is known to last only from 4 to 6 hours.[A176945] As part of the effect, ipratropium relaxes the bronchial airways which reverse the narrowing that accounts for wheezy breathing, chest tightness, cough and abnormal gas exchange.[T457]\r\n\r\nIn clinical trials where ipratropium was used in the initial management of status asthmaticus, it was demonstrated a clear benefit in pulmonary function in children and adults. However, the continuous use of ipratropium after an acute asthmatic attack is not proven to be significantly advantageous[A176939] nor the prophylactic administration of this agent.[T542]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Ipratropium acts as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.[A176939] This effect produces the inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system in the airways and hence, inhibit their function. The function of the parasympathetic system in the airway is to generate bronchial secretions and constriction and hence, the inhibition of this action can lead to bronchodilation and fewer secretions.[A176945]\r\n\r\nAt the cellular level, the diameter of the airways is controlled by the release of acetylcholine into the muscle cells causing them to contract and producing a narrow airway. Thus administration of ipratropium stops the activity of acetylcholine in the smooth muscle preventing the contraction and producing relaxed airways.[T457]",
    "toxicity": "The reported LD50 in mice after oral administration of ipratropium is 1500 mg/kg.[MSDS] However, overdosage is not very likely due to the poor absorption of ipratropium.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nIpratropium was not shown to present carcinogenesis, teratogenesis not mutagenesis potential and it did not present effects on fertility. The only effect after high administration of ipratropium was a reduction in the conception rate.[FDA label]",
    "metabolism": "Ipratropium is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract by the activity of the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes.[A176945] From the orally administered dose, about 90% of the dose is excreted unchanged. The absorbed portion is partially metabolized by ester hydrolysis to inactive metabolites, tropic acid and tropane.[T85]",
    "absorption": "Ipratropium is a topically active but poorly absorbed agent.[T539] The lack of absorption potential in the mucosal surfaces is associated with the presence of a charge in the 5-valent nitrogen. The molecule itself presents very large topic effectiveness however, it does not produce detectable blood levels nor systemic effects.[T542]\r\n\r\nSerum levels of ipratropium after oral or inhaled administration are very low, corresponding to only 1-2% of the administered dose. These low levels peak after 1-",
    "half_life": "Ipratropium presents a short half-life of about 1.6 hours.[A176945]",
    "protein_binding": "The protein binding of ipratropium is very low as the level of circulating ipratropium is very minimal. The bound state represents only from 0-9% of the administered dose.[T445]",
    "route_of_elimination": "About 80-100% of the administered dose of ipratropium is excreted in the urine leaving less than 20% of the dose to be eliminated through the feces.[A176945] From the urine eliminated portion, almost all the drug is found unchanged.[T542]\r\n\r\nHowever, when ipratropium is orally administered, due to i",

    "name": "Olanzapine",
    "description": "Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic agent.[A176996] The second-generation antipsychotics were introduced in the 90s and quickly gained traction due to their impressive efficacy, reduced risk for extrapyramidal side effects and reduced susceptibility to drug-drug interactions.[A177011] Olanzapine very closely resembles [clozapine] and only differs by two additional methyl groups and the absence of a chloride moiety.[T554] It was discovered by scientists at Eli Lilly and approved to be marketed in the US in 1996.[T548]",
    "indication": "Olanzapine was initially used orally and intramuscularly for the chronic treatment of schizophrenia in patients over 13 years old and other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar I disorder including mixed or manic episodes.[A177014] \r\n\r\nOlanzapine is also indicated, in combination with lithium or valproate for the short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nAs well, olanzapine is indicated, in combination with fluoxetine for the treatment of episodes of depression associated with bipolar disorder type 1 and treatment-resistant depression in patients over 10 years old.[A177014]\r\n\r\nOlanzapine is also approved for the management of psychomotor agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nSchizophrenia is a complex biochemical brain disorder that affects the person's ability to differentiate reality. It is usually observed as the presence of delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal and d",
    "pharmacodynamics": "The effect of olanzapine in the D2 receptor is reported to produce the positive effects of this drug such as a decrease in hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized thought, and disorganized behavior. On the other hand, its effect on the serotonin 5HT2A receptor prevents the onset of anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition and poor attention.[A177014] Based on the specific mechanism of action, olanzapine presents a higher affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor when compared to the rest of the dopamine receptor isotypes. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects.[T554]\r\n\r\nClinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents.[A177008]\r\n\r\nThe effect of olanzapine on dopamine and serotonin receptors has been suggested to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and v",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors.[A176993, A176999]\r\n\r\nAs abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.[A177014]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors. This determined effect allows for a decrease in adverse effects.[A177014]",
    "toxicity": "The toxicity symptoms of olanzapine are known to include somnolence, mydriasis, blurred vision, respiratory depression, hypotension, extrapyramidal symptoms and anticholinergic effects. The overdosage effects in children are generally associated with more significant side effects.[A177059]\r\n\r\nThe maximum registered dosage of olanzapine in clinical trials was of 300 mg and it was reported to present drowsiness and slurred speech. However, on post-marketing surveillance, a wide range of symptoms h",
    "metabolism": "Olanzapine is greatly metabolized in the liver, which represents around 40% of the administered dose, mainly by the activity of glucuronide enzymes and by the cytochrome P450 system. From the CYP system, the main metabolic enzymes are CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.[A177014] As part of the phase I metabolism, the major circulating metabolites of olanzapine, accounting for approximate 50-60% of this phase, are the 10-N-glucuronide and the 4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine which are clinically inactive and formed by t",
    "absorption": "Olanzapine presents a linear pharmacokinetic profile and, after daily administration, it reaches steady-state in about a week.[A177014] Under the administration of a normal dosage of olanzapine, the steady-state plasma concentration does not seem to exceed 150 ng/ml with an AUC of 333 ng/h/ml.[A177059, T554]\r\n\r\nThe absorption of olanzapine is not affected by the concomitant administration of food. The pharmacokinetic profile of olanzapine is characterized by reaching peak plasma concentration of",
    "half_life": "Olanzapine presents a half-life ranging between 21 to 54 hours with an average half-life of 30 hours.[A177014]",
    "protein_binding": "Olanzapine is largely bound to plasma proteins and hence, about 93% of the administered dose is bound. The main proteins for binding are albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.[A177014]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Olanzapine is mainly eliminated through metabolism and hence, only 7% of the eliminated drug can be found as the unchanged form. It is mainly excreted in the urine which represents around 53% of the excreted dose followed by the feces that represent about 30%.[A177014]",

    "description": "Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions. \r\n\r\nSir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. Atenolol itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.[label]\r\n\r\nDespite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]",
    "indication": "**Indicated** for:[label]\r\n\r\n1) Management of hypertension alone and in combination with other antihypertensives.\r\n\r\n2) Management of angina pectoris associated with coronary atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\n3) Management of acute myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable patients with a heart rate greater than 50 beats per minutes and a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg.\r\n\r\n**Off-label** uses include:\r\n\r\n1) Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.[A178156]\r\n\r\n2) Management of heart failure.[A178153]\r\n\r\n3) Management of atrial fibrillation.[A178141]\r\n\r\n4) Management of supraventricular tachycardia.[A178162]\r\n\r\n5) Management of ventricular arrythmias such as congenital long-QT and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.[A178168]\r\n\r\n6) Management of symptomatic thyrotoxicosis in combination with [methimazole].[A178147]\r\n\r\n7) Prophylaxis of migraine headaches.[A178171]\r\n\r\n8) Management of alcohol withdrawal.[A178174,A178177]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart.[label] It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.[label,T116,A178258] Together the decreases in contractility and rate produce a reduction in cardiac output resulting in a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance in the short-term. This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially impr",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than β2 receptors.[A178372] Selective activity at the β1 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to β2 and possibly β3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. β1 and β2 receptors are G<sub>s</sub> coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA). \r\n\r\nIn cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.[A178396] L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to",

    "description": "Diltiazem is a benzothiazepine derivative with antihypertensive and vasodilating properties. Approved in 1982 by the FDA, it is a member of the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers drug class. It works through various mechanisms of action, but it primarily works by inhibiting the calcium influx into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle during depolarization.[L10556] Compared to dihydropyridine drugs, such as [nifedipine], that preferentially act on vascular smooth muscle and [verapamil] that directly acts on the heart muscle, diltiazem displays an intermediate specificity to target both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.[T28] Being a potent vasodilator, diltiazem is used clinically as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and as an anti-anginal agent [L6289] for the management of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, chronic stable angina, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter. Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities.[L6289] Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones.",
    "indication": "**Oral**\r\n\r\nIndicated for the management of hypertension, to lower blood pressure, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.[L10556]\r\n\r\nIndicated for use to improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina.[L10556]\r\n\r\nIndicated for the management of variant angina (Prinzmetal's angina).[L6298]\r\n\r\n**Intravenous**\r\n\r\nIndicated for the short-term management of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter for temporary control of rapid ventricular rate.[L6292]\r\n\r\nIndicated for the rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. This includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias associated with an extranodal accessory pathway such as the WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.[L6292]\r\n\r\n**Off-label**\r\n\r\nIndicated for off-label uses in anal fissures (as topical formulation), migraine prophylaxis, cramps in lower leg related to rest, pulmonary hypertension,[L6289] idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and prote",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Diltiazem is an antihypertensive and vasodilating agent that works by relaxing the vascular muscle and reducing blood pressure. This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L10556] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate).[L6289] It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate.[A178432,T28] Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow.[L6292] Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in is",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Excitation of cardiac muscle involves the activation of a slow calcium inward current that is induced by L-type slow calcium channels, which are voltage-sensitive, ion-selective channels[A178444] associated with a high activation threshold and slow inactivation profile.[T28] L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential.[A178492] Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel.[A178444] It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites.[A178444] Diltiazem is a slow calcium channel blocker that binds to the extracellular site of the alpha-1C subunit of the channel, which is thought to be the S5-6 linker region of the transmembrane domain IV and/or S6 segment of domain III.[A178492]  Diltia",
    "toxicity": "**Clinical Toxicity and Overdose**\r\n\r\nThe oral LD<sub>50</sub> ranges from 415 to 740mg/kg in mice and 560 to 810 mg/kg in rats. The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in dogs is considered to be in excess of 50 mg/kg. A dose of 360 mg/kg resulted in lethality in monkeys. The intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> is 60 mg/kg in mice and 38 mg/kg in rats. \r\n\r\nCases of overdose from doses ranging from less than 1 g to 18 g have been reported with diltiazem, with several cases involving multiple drug ingestions resulting ",
    "metabolism": "Diltiazem is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, which explains its relatively low absolute oral bioavailability. It undergoes N-demethylation primarily mediated by CYP3A4. CYP2D6 is responsible for O-demethylation and esterases mediate deacetylation.[A39292] There was large inter-individual variability in the circulating plasma levels of metabolites in healthy volunteers.[A178516]\r\n\r\nIn healthy volunteers, the major circulating metabolites in the plasma are N-monodesmethyl diltilazem, d",
    "absorption": "Diltiazem is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Minimum therapeutic plasma diltiazem concentrations appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL. Following oral administration of extended formulations of 360 mg diltiazem, the drug in plasma was detectable within 3 to 4 hours and the peak plasma concentrations were reached between 11 and 18 hours post-dose. Diltiazem peak and systemic exposures were not affected by concurrent food intake.[L10556] Due to hepatic first-pass metabolis",
    "half_life": "The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.0 to 4.5 hours following single and multiple oral doses. The half-life may slightly increase with dose and the extent of hepatic impairment.[L10556] The apparent elimination half-life for diltiazem as extended-release tablets after single or multiple dosing is 6 to 9 hours.[L10556] The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.4 hours following administration of a single intravenous injection.[L6292] The elimination half-lives of pharmacologically active metabolites are longer than that of diltiazem.[A178516]",
    "protein_binding": "Diltiazem is about 70-80% bound to plasma proteins, according to _in vitro_ binding studies.[L10556] About 40% of the drug is thought to bind to alpha-1-glycoprotein at clinically significant concentrations while about 30% of the drug is bound to albumin.[L6292]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Due to its extensive metabolism, only 2% to 4% of the unchanged drug can be detected in the urine.[L10556] The major urinary metabolite in healthy volunnteers was N-monodesmethyl diltiazem, followed by deacetyl N,O-didesmethyl diltiazem, deacetyl N-monodesmethyl diltiazem, and deacetyl diltiazem; ho",

    "description": "Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic _piperazino-azepine_ antidepressant agent that was initially approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Netherlands in 1994.[A177946] This drug was first manufactured by Organon Inc., and received FDA approval in 1997 for the treatment of major depressive disorder.[T595, L6157] The effects of this drug may be observed as early as 1 week after beginning therapy.[A178144,L6160]\r\n\r\nIn addition to its beneficial effects in depression, mirtazapine has been reported to be efficacious in the off-label management of various other conditions.  It may improve the symptoms of neurological disorders, reverse weight loss caused by medical conditions, improve sleep, and prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery.[A177811]",
    "indication": "This drug is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder and its associated symptoms.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nMirtazapine has been used off-label for a variety of conditions including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, tension headaches, hot flushes, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disorders, substance abuse disorders, and sexual disorders, among others.[A177811,A177946]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "**General effects and a note on suicidality**\r\n\r\nMirtazapine is effective in treating moderate to severe depression and treats many symptoms normally associated with this condition. These symptoms may include disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and anhedonia, in addition to anxiety.[A555,A178150,T595]. It is important to note that suicidal ideation and behavior may emerge or increase during treatment with mirtazapine, as with any other antidepressant. This risk is especially pronounced in younger individuals. Patients, medical professionals, and families should monitor for suicidal thoughts, worsening depression, anxiety, agitation, sleep changes, irritable behavior, aggression, impulsivity, restlessness, and other unusual behavior when this drug is taken or the dose is adjusted.[FDA label] Do not administer mirtazapine to children. When deciding to prescribe this drug, carefully consider the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in young adults.[FDA label]\r\n\r\n**E",
    "mechanism_of_action": "**Summary**\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understood[FDA label] but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. This drug exhibits a fast onset of action, a high level of response, a manageable side-effect profile, and dual noradrenergic and serotonergic effects that are unique from the effects of other antidepressants.[A177811]\r\n\r\n**Effects on various receptors**\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The results of these studies demonstrate mirtazapine exerts antagonist activity at presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is thought to lead to enhanced noradrenergic and serotonergic activity [FDA label], which are known to improve the symptoms of depression and form the basis of antidepressant therapy.[A178198, A178201]\r\n\r\nMirtazapine is a strong antagonist of serotonin 5-HT2 and ",
    "toxicity": "**LD50**\r\n\r\nOral LD50 was 830 mg/kg in male Swiss mice 24 hours after being administered mirtazapine.[F4597]  \r\n\r\n**Overdose information**\r\n\r\nActivated charcoal should be administered during an overdose to absorb excess mirtazapine. General supportive therapy should be employed, including maintenance of an adequate airway, oxygen therapy, and ventilation therapy. Vital signs and cardiac rhythm must be monitored. It is not advisable to induce vomiting. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric ",
    "metabolism": "Mirtazapine is heavily metabolized in humans.[FDA label] Demethylation and hydroxylation and subsequent glucuronide conjugation are the major pathways by which mirtazapine is metabolized.[A177826,FDA label] Data from in vitro studies on human liver microsomes show that cytochrome 2D6 and 1A2 lead to the formation of the _8-hydroxy metabolite_ of mirtazapine. The  CYP3A enzyme metabolizes this drug into its _N-desmethyl and N-oxide_ metabolites. There are various other unconjugated metabolites of",
    "absorption": "The absorption of this drug is rapid and complete.[A177826, FDA label] Due to first pass metabolism in the liver and metabolism in the gut wall, absolute bioavailability is about 50%.[FDA label,A177826] Peak blood concentrations are attained within about 2 hours after an oral dose. Food has little effect on the absorption of mirtazapine, and no dose adjustment is required if it is taken with food.[FDA label] Steady-state levels are achieved by about 5 days after the initial dose.[FDA label, A177",

Due to their selectivity for the peripheral blood vessels, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are associated with a lower incidence of myocardial depression and cardiac conduction abnormalities than other calcium channel blockers [A175327].\r\n\r\nAmlodipine is commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure and angina. Amlodipine has antioxidant properties and an ability to enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator that decreases blood pressure [A175321].

During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with a",
    "mechanism_of_action": "**Mechanism of action on blood pressure**\r\n\r\nAmlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label].

    "description": "Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine indicated for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders.[L34783, L34788] It is mainly metabolized by CYP3As and so is contraindicated with CYP3A inhibitors like ketoconazole and itraconazole.[L34783, L34788] Benzodiazepine treatment should be stopped gradually by tapering down a patient's dose to avoid withdrawal symptoms.[A18125] Alprazolam's adverse effects are generally related to the sedation it can cause.[A18125] Alprazolam has been mixed with alcohol as a drug of abuse to potentiate the sedative effects of the drug which may lead to coma and death.[A18125] Alprazolam was given FDA approval on October 16, 1981.[L6148]",
    "indication": "Alprazolam is indicated for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults.[L34783] Alprazolam is also indicated, either as a standard or extended-release formulation, for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.[L34783, L34788]\r\n\r\nAlprazolam may also be prescribed off-label for insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and depression.[A177973]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain.[L34783, L34788] Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; patients taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently may require lower doses of one or both medications, depending on their clinical situation. Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.[A236793, A236798]\r\n\r\nThe most prevalent GAB",

    "description": "Montelukast was first approved for clinical use by the US FDA in 1998 as Merck's brand name Singulair.[L6301] The medication is a member of the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) category of drugs.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Although capable of demonstrating effectiveness, the use of such LTRAs like montelukast is typically in addition to or complementary with the use of inhaled corticosteroids or other agents in asthma step therapy.[A178645] Regardless, in 2008-2009, there were FDA-led investigations into the possibility of montelukast to elicit neuropsychiatric effects like agitation, hallucinations, suicidal behaviour, and others in individuals who used the medication.[A178651] And although these kinds of effects are currently included in the official prescribing information for montelukast,[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] the drug still sees extensive use worldwide via millions of prescriptions annually and has since become available as a generic and as a brand name product.",
    "indication": "Montelukast is indicated for:\r\n\r\n(a) the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients who are 12 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307] and also include indications for preventing day and night-time symptoms, and the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid-sensitive asthma[L6304];\r\n\r\n(b) the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients who are 6 years of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307]; and\r\n\r\n(c) the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]\r\n\r\nIn particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use o",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]\r\n\r\nIn particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of alle",
    "toxicity": "The adverse effects associated with overdosage of montelukast include abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, and less frequently, convulsion.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]\r\n\r\nThe oral LD50 value determined for mice and rats is >5000 mg/kg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]\r\n\r\nMontelukast has not been studied in pregnant women.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Consequently, it should be used during pregnancy only if clear",
    "metabolism": "It has been determined that montelukast is highly metabolized and typically so by the cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 isoenzymes.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] In particular, it seems that the CYP2C8 enzymes play a significant role in the metabolism of the drug.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, at therapeutic doses, the plasma concentrations of montelukast metabolites are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310",
    "absorption": "It has been observed that montelukast is quickly absorbed following administration by the oral route.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] The oral bioavailability documented for the drug is 64%.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Furthermore, it seems that having a regular meal in the morning or even a high fat snack in the evening does not affect the absorption of montelukast.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]",

Duloxetine continues to be investigated for the treatment of pain in cancer, surgery, and more.",

    "pharmacodynamics": "Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.\r\n\r\nAction at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain.

Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into t",
    "toxicity": "**Overdose**\r\n\r\nFatalities have been reported with doses of 1000mg involving both mixed drugs as well as duloxetine alone.[label] Signs and symptoms of overdose include: somnolence, coma, serotonin syndrome, seizure, syncope, hypo- or hypertension, tachycardia, and vomiting.

    "description": "Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone that has spawned many derivative antibiotics.[A178870] It is formulated for oral, intravenous, intratympanic, ophthalmic, and otic administration for a number of bacterial infections.[L6469,L6472,L6475,L6478,L6481,L6484,L6487,L6490,L6493]\r\n\r\nThe first ciprofloxacin containing product was FDA approved on 22 October 1987.[L6463]",
    "indication": "Ciprofloxacin is only indicated in infections caused by susceptible bacteria.[L6469,L6472,L6475,L6478,L6481,L6484,L6487,L6490,L6493]\r\n\r\nCiprofloxacin immediate release tablets, oral suspensions, and intravenous injections are indicated for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, bone and joint infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, nosocomial pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, adults who have inhaled anthrax, plague, chronic bacterial prostatitis, lower respiratory tract infections including acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections in pediatrics, complicated pyelonephritis in pediatrics, and acute sinusitis.[L6481,L6478]\r\n\r\nA ciprofloxacin otic solution and otic suspension with hydrocortisone are indicated for acute otitis externa.[L6469,L6484] Ciprofloxacin suspension with dexamethasone is indicated for acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes or acute otitis externa.[L6490]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone that is active against many Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria.[A178870,L6469,L6472,L6475,L6478,L6481,L6484,L6487,L6490,L6493] It produces its action through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.[A178885] Ciprofloxacin binds to bacterial DNA gyrase with 100 times the affinity of mammalian DNA gyrase.[A178894] There is no cross resistance between fluoroquinolones and other classes of antibiotics, so it may be of clinical value when other antibiotics are no longer effective.[A178894] Ciprofloxain and its derivatives are also being investigated for its action against malaria, cancers, and AIDS.[A178885]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Ciprofloxacin acts on bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV.[A178885] Ciprofloxacin's targeting of the alpha subunits of DNA gyrase prevents it from supercoiling the bacterial DNA which prevents DNA replication.[A178876,A178882]",
    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing an overdose may present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, crystalluria, nephrotoxicity, and oliguria.[A178954,A178957,A178960] Ciprofloxacin overdose typically leads to acute renal failure.[A178960] An overdose may progress over the next 6 days with rising serum creatinine and BUN, as well as anuria.[A178957] Patients may require prednisone therapy, urgent hemodialysis, or supportive therapy.[A178954,A178960] Depending on the degree of overdose, patients may recover no",
    "metabolism": "Ciprofloxacin is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2.[L6481] The primary metabolites oxociprofloxacin and sulociprofloxacin make up 3-8% of the total dose each.[L6487] Ciprofloxacin is also converted to the minor metabolites desethylene ciprofloxacin and formylciprofloxacin.[L6487] These 4 metabolites account for 15% of a total oral dose.[L6481]\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of available data on the enzymes and types of reactions involved in forming these metabolites.[A178822,A178819,A178828,A178831]",

    "mechanism_of_action": "Propranolol is a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist.[A179902] Blocking of these receptors leads to vasoconstriction, inhibition of angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic growth factor of fibroblasts (bFGF), induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells, as well as down regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.[A179902]",
    "toxicity": "Symptoms of overdose include hypotension, hypoglycemic seizure, restlessness, euphoria, insomnia.[L6901] Patients with asthma may develop bronchospasm.[L6901] In case of overdose, monitor vital signs, mental status, and blood glucose.[L6901] Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids, bradycardia with atropine, and isoproterenol and aminophylline for bronchospasm.[L6901] If patients do not respond to intravenous fluids, follow up with glucagon 50-150µg/kg intravenously, then 1-5mg/hour, followed ",
    "metabolism": "Propranolol undergoes side chain oxidation to α-naphthoxylactic acid, ring oxidation to 4’-hydroxypropranolol, or glucuronidation to propranolol glucuronide.[A36551] It can also be N-desisopropylated to become N-desisopropyl propranolol.[A179878] 17% of a dose undergoes glucuronidation and 42% undergoes ring oxidation.[A180298]",
    "absorption": "Patients taking doses of 40mg, 80mg, 160mg, and 320mg daily experienced C<sub>max</sub> values of 18±15ng/mL, 52±51ng/mL, 121±98ng/mL, and 245±110ng/mL respectively.[A180289] Propranolol has a T<sub>max</sub> of approximately 2 hours, though this can range from 1 to 4 hours in fasting patients.[A180295] Taking propranolol with food does not increase T<sub>max</sub> but does increase bioavailability.[A180295]",
    "half_life": "The elimination half-life of propranolol is approximately 8 hours.[L6907] The plasma half-life of propranolol is 3 to 6 hours.[L6901,L6904]",

    "description": "Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.\r\n\r\nCommonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing [hydrochlorothiazide] that is used for the management of hypertension.

    "description": "Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants.[A181180] It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression.[T646] A unique feature of this drug is that it does not promote the anxiety symptoms, sexual symptoms, or insomnia, which are commonly associated with SSRI and SNRI therapy.[T646] Trazodone acts on various receptors, including certain histamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors, distinguishing it from other antidepressants that cover a narrow range of neurotransmitters.[T646] It was initially granted FDA approval in 1981.[L3484]",
    "indication": "Trazodone is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).[L3484] It has been used off-label for adjunct therapy in alcohol dependence, and off-label to treat anxiety and insomnia.[L3484] It may also be used off-label to treat symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and fibromyalgia due to its effects on various neurotransmitter receptors.[A31634]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Trazodone treats depressed mood and other depression-related symptoms and shows benefit in the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating effects.[T646] It is known to prolong the cardiac QT-interval.[L3484] Memory, alertness, and cognition may be decreased by trazodone, especially in elderly patients due to its central nervous system depressant effects.[A181177]\r\n\r\nA note on priapism\r\n\r\nTrazodone has been associated with the occurrence of priapism, a painful and persistent incidence of penile tissue erection that is unrelievable and can cause permanent neurological damage if left untreated. Patients must be advised to seek immediate medical attention if priapism is suspected.[A181198,L3484]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The mechanism of action of trazodone is not fully understood, however, it is known to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and block both histamine and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.[T646]  Despite the fact that trazodone is frequently considered a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, several reports have shown that other mechanisms including antagonism at serotonin 5-HT1a, 5-HT1c, and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes may occur.[A181177,T646] The strongest antagonism of trazodone is reported to occur at the serotonin \r\n5-HT21c receptors, preventing serotonin uptake.[A985] In addition to acting on serotonin receptors, trazodone has been shown to inhibit serotonin transporters.[A4334,A181457]  The antidepressant effects of trazodone result from the inhibition of receptor uptake, which normally decreases circulating neurotransmitters, contributing to depressive symptoms.[A181186,A175840]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD50 of trazodone is 690 mg/kg in rats.[L7483]\r\n\r\nAn overdose of trazodone may result in central nervous system, cardiac, respiratory effects. Signs and symptoms may include dyspnea, bradycardia, hypotension, mental status changes, lack of coordination, and coma, among others.[L7486]  In addition, an overdose may result in priapism, a persistent unrelievable penile tissue erection that may cause permanent damage if not treated promptly.[A181198] No specific antidote exists for a trazodo",
    "metabolism": "Trazodone is heavily metabolized and activated in the liver by CYP3A4 enzyme to the active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP).[A987,A988] The full metabolism of trazodone has not been well characterized.[L7483] Some other metabolites that have been identified are a dihydrodiol metabolite and carboxylic acid.[A986]",
    "absorption": "Trazodone is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, with a bioavailability ranging from 63-91% [A181177] and an AUC0−t of 18193.0 ng·h/mL.[A181204] Food may impact absorption in a variable fashion, and may sometimes lead to decreases in the Cmax of trazodone.[A181177,A181201] In the fed state in 8 healthy volunteers, the Cmax was measured to be 1.47 +/- 0.16 micrograms/mL, and in the fasted state, was measured at 1.88 +/- 0.42 micrograms/mL. The average Tmax af",
    "half_life": "The plasma elimination half-life was markedly prolonged (13.6 versus 6 hours) elderly volunteers in the fasted state when compared with younger volunteers.[A181177] Another study of 8 healthy individuals taking a single dose of trazodone indicated a terminal elimination half-life of 7.3 +/- 0.8 hr.[A181201] \r\n\r\nA two-phase pattern of trazodone elimination has been reported. Initially, the half-life is reported to range from 3 to 6 hours and the second phase of elimination to range from 5 to 9 hours.[L7547]",

    "name": "Verapamil",
    "description": "Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina,[L8791] and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s.[A188514] It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like [diltiazem] and [flunarizine], but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications.[L8791] Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-enantiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-enantiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-enantiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate.[A188435]",
    "indication": "Verapamil is indicated in the treatment of vasopastic (i.e. Prinzmetal's) angina, unstable angina, and chronic stable angina. It is also indicated to treat hypertension, for the prophylaxis of repetitive paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and in combination with digoxin to control ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.[L8791] Given intravenously, it is indicated for the treatment of various supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including rapid conversion to sinus rhythm in patients with supraventricular tachycardia and for temporary control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.[L10481]\r\n\r\nVerapamil is commonly used off-label for prophylaxis of cluster headaches.[A13983]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker with antiarrhythmic, antianginal, and antihypertensive activity.[L8791] Immediate-release verapamil has a relatively short duration of action, requiring dosing 3 to 4 times daily,[L8791] but extended-release formulations are available that allow for once-daily dosing.[L10478,L10637] As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.[L10478]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,[L10478]Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility.[A175396] Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart's electrical pacemaker activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.[L10478] \r\n\r\nVerapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels through",
    "toxicity": "Verapamil's reported oral TDLo is 14.4 mg/kg in women and 3.429 mg/kg in men.[L10523] The oral LD<sub>50</sub> is 150 mg/kg in rats and 163 mg/kg in mice.[L10523]\r\n\r\nAs there is no antidote for verapamil overdosage, treatment is largely supportive. Symptoms of overdose are generally consistent with verapamil's adverse effect profile (i.e. hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia) but instances of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema have been observed following ingestion of large overdoses (up to 9 grams",
    "metabolism": "Verapamil is extensively metabolized by the liver, with up to 80% of an administered dose subject to elimination via pre-systemic metabolism - interestingly, this first-pass metabolism appears to clear the S-enantiomer of verapamil much faster than the R-enantiomer.[L10478,A415] The remaining parent drug undergoes O-demethylation, N-dealkylation, and N-demethylation to a number of different metabolites via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.[A415] Norverapamil, one of the major circulating metabo",
    "absorption": "More than 90% of orally administered verapamil is absorbed - despite this, bioavailability ranges only from 20% to 30% due to rapid biotransformation following first-pass metabolism in the portal circulation.[L8791] Absorption kinetic parameters are largely dependent on the specific formulation of verapamil involved. Immediate-release verapamil reaches peak plasma concentrations (i.e. T<sub>max</sub>) between 1-2 hours following administration,[L8791] whereas sustained-release formulations tend ",
    "half_life": "Single-dose studies of immediate-release verapamil have demonstrated an elimination half-life of 2.8 to 7.4 hours, which increases to 4.5 to 12.0 hours following repetitive dosing.[L8791] The elimination half-life is also prolonged in patients with hepatic insufficiency (14 to 16 hours) and in the elderly (approximately 20 hours).[L10478] Intravenously administered verapamil has rapid distribution phase half-life of approximately 4 minutes, followed by a terminal elimination phase half-life of 2 to 5 hours.[L10481]",
    "protein_binding": "Verapamil is extensively protein-bound in plasma. R-verapamil is 94% bound to serum albumin while S-verapamil is 88% bound. Additionally, R-verapamil is 92% bound to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and S-verapamil is 86% bound.[L8791]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Approximately 70% of an administered dose is excreted as metabolites in the urine and ≥16% in the feces within 5 days. Approximately 3% - 4% is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug.[L8791]",

    "description": "Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug commonly known as Paxil. It has a variety of uses, including the treatment of anxiety disorders, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and symptoms of menopause, among others.[T653] It was approved by the FDA in the early 1990s and marketed by SmithKline Beecham.[L7712,L7715] A unique feature of this drug is that it is highly potent and selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake and has little effect on other neurotransmitters.[A31914] Because of its potent inhibition of serotonin reuptake, paroxetine is more likely to cause withdrawal effects upon cessation. Paroxetine is well tolerated in most patients with a similar adverse effect profile to other members of its drug class.[A31914] The controlled release formulation was designed to decrease the likelihood of nausea that is sometimes associated with paroxetine.[L7700,L7742]",
    "indication": "Paroxetine is indicated for the management of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder.[L3358] One form of paroxetine, commercially known as Brisdelle, is used to manage mild to moderate vasomotor symptoms of menopause.[L7703] Off-label, paroxetine may be used for the treatment of premature ejaculation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).[A1093,A181754,A181904]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Paroxetine treats the symptoms of depression, various anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the vasomotor symptoms of menopause via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake.[T653,L3358,L7703] The onset of action of paroxetine is reported to be approximately 6 weeks.[A181874]\r\n\r\nDue its serotonergic activity, paroxetine, like other SSRI drugs, may potentiate serotonin syndrome. This risk is especially high when monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are given within 2 weeks of paroxetine administration. Upon cessation of MAO inhibitors, a 2-week interval before paroxetine administration is recommended. Do not coadminister these agents.[T656]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Paroxetine enhances serotonergic activity via the inhibition presynaptic reuptake of serotonin by the serotonin (SERT) receptor.[A5492,A181772] This inhibition raises the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, relieving various symptoms. This drug has been demonstrated to be a stronger inhibitor of serotonin reuptake than other members of the same drug class, including [Citalopram], [Fluoxetine], and [Fluvoxamine].[A31914] The mechanism of action of paroxetine in relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause is unknown, according to the Brisdelle prescribing information[L7703], but may occur due to its effects on thermoregulation.[A181973]\r\n\r\nParoxetine shows a clinically insignificant affinity for adrenergic alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and β-adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors.[A31914] This drug shows some affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors and 5-H2B receptors.[A181829,A181847] The",
    "toxicity": "The acute LD50 in mice and rats is 350 mg/kg.[L7733]\r\n\r\nOverdose information\r\n\r\nThe lowest dose of paroxetine reported to lead to a fatal outcome is approximately 400 mg. The largest reported paroxetine overdose from which a patient has survived and recovered is a dose of 2000 mg.  Common manifestations in a paroxetine overdose include fatigue, fever, insomnia hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, tremor, dizziness, agitation, confusion, anxious symptoms, headache, insomnia, h",
    "metabolism": "Paroxetine metabolism occurs in the liver and is largely mediated by cytochrome CYP2D6 with contributions from CYP3A4 and possibly other cytochrome enzymes.[A415,T656]  Genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 enzyme may alter the pharmacokinetics of this drug. Poor metabolizers may demonstrate increased adverse effects while rapid metabolizers may experience decreased therapeutic effects.[A31914,A181769,L7718] \r\n\r\nThe majority of a paroxetine dose is oxidized to a catechol metabolite that is subsequ",
    "absorption": "Paroxetine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Due to the first-pass metabolism, the bioavailability ranges from 30-60%. Cmax is attained 2 to 8 hours after an oral dose.[A181760] Mean Tmax is 4.3 hours in healthy patients.[L7706]  The steady-state concentration of paroxetine is achieved within 7 to 14 days of oral therapy.[A31914] In a pharmacokinetic study, AUC in healthy patients was 574 ng·h/mL and 1053 ng·h/mL in those with moderate renal impairment.[L7706]",
    "half_life": "The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine is about 21 hours.[L3358] In healthy young subjects, mean elimination half-life was found to be 17.3 hours.[L7706]",
    "protein_binding": "Paroxetine is 95% bound to plasma proteins.[A181760,A181799,L3358]",
    "route_of_elimination": "About 2/3 of a single paroxetine dose is found to be excreted in the urine and the remainder is found to be excreted in feces. Almost all of the dose is eliminated as metabolites; 3% is found to be excreted as unchanged paroxetine.[A31914] About 64% of a 30 mg oral dose was found excreted in the uri",

    "description": "Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[L12885] It is one of the most widely used SGAs. [Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).[L12885]\r\n\r\nSchizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L12885]\r\n\r\nRisperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]",
    "indication": "Risperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia [L12885,L44692,L46297] and irritability associated with autistic disorder.[L12885] It is also indicated as monotherapy, or adjunctly with lithium or valproic acid, for the treatment of acute mania or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.[L12885,L44692]\r\n\r\nRisperidone is additionally indicated in Canada for the short-term symptomatic management of aggression or psychotic symptoms in patients with severe dementia of the Alzheimer type unresponsive to nonpharmacological approaches.[L12906]\r\n\r\nRisperidone is also used off-label for a number of conditions including as an adjunct to antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.[A177226]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[A1115,A1116]\r\n\r\nRisperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain.[A1114,A1115] Risperidone binds to D2 receptors with a lower affinity than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, which bind with very high affinity. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.[A1119,A1117]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[A1115, A1116, A1117]\r\n\r\nD2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.[A251765] Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.[A1119,A31773] Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic rece",
    "toxicity": "Symptoms of overdose include lethargy, dystonia/spasm, tachycardia, bradycardia, and seizures. LD<sub>50</sub>=57.7 mg/kg (rat, oral) and 34 mg/kg (rat, intravenous).[A1117,A1118,A1119]",
    "metabolism": "Extensively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme to 9-hydroxyrisperidone (i.e. [paliperidone]), which has approximately the same receptor binding affinity as risperidone.[A1118,A31772] Hydroxylation is dependent on debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase and metabolism is sensitive to genetic polymorphisms in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase.[A1119,A31772] Risperidone also undergoes N-dealkylation to a lesser extent.[A1119,A31772]",
    "absorption": "Well absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of risperidone is 70% (CV=25%). The relative oral bioavailability of risperidone from a tablet is 94% (CV=10%) when compared to a solution.[L12885]",
    "half_life": "3 hours in extensive metabolizers[A31772]\r\nUp to 20 hours in poor metabolizers[A31772]",
    "protein_binding": "Risperidone and its active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, are ~88% and ~77% protein-bound in human plasma, respectively.[A31772,L12885] They each bind to both serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.[L12885]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver. In healthy elderly subjects, renal clearance of both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone was decreased, and elimination half-lives are prolonged compared to young healthy subjects.[A31772,L1214]",

    "drugbank_id": "DB00763",
    "name": "Methimazole",
    "description": "Methimazole is a thionamide antithyroid agent that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones.[A184559,A184733,A184694] It was first introduced as an antithyroid agent in 1949[A184502] and is now commonly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in those for whom more aggressive options such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are inappropriate.[L8336,L8339]\r\n\r\nOn a weight basis, methimazole is 10 times more potent than the other major antithyroid thionamide used in North America, [propylthiouracil],[L8339] and is the active metabolite of the pro-drug [carbimazole], which is an antithyroid medication used in the United Kingdom and parts of the former British Commonwealth.[A184733] Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter,[A184757] with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Despite documented teratogenic effects in its published labels,[L8336,L8339] the true teratogenicity of methimazole appears to be unclear[A184643,A184757,A184763] and its place in therapy may change in the future.",
    "indication": "In the United States, methimazole is indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter for whom thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy are not appropriate treatment options. Methimazole is also indicated for the amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy.[L8336]\r\n\r\nIn Canada, methimazole carries the above indications and is also indicated for the medical treatment of hyperthyroidism regardless of other available treatment options.[L8339]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones resulting in an alleviation of hyperthyroidism.[L8336][L8339] Onset of action occurs within 12 to 18 hours, and its duration of action is 36 to 72 hours, likely due to concentration of methimazole and some metabolites within the thyroid gland after administration.[A184643]\r\n\r\nThe most serious potential side effect of methimazole therapy is agranulocytosis, and patients should be instructed to monitor for, and report, any signs or symptoms of agranulocytosis such as fever or sore throat. Other cytopenias may also occur during methimazole therapy. There also exists the potential for severe hepatic toxicity with the use of methimazole, and monitoring for signs and symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, such as jaundice, anorexia, pruritus, and elevation in liver transaminases, is prudent in patients using this therapy.[L8336,L8339]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Methimazole's primary mechanism of action appears to be interference in an early step in thyroid hormone synthesis involving thyroid peroxidase (TPO), however the exact method through which methimazole inhibits this step is unclear.[A184559]  TPO, along with hydrogen peroxide, normally catalyzes the conversion of iodide to iodine and then further catalyzes the incorporation of this iodine onto the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin. These thyroglobulin molecules then degrade within thyroid follicular cells to form either thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) or tri-iodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland.[A184697]\r\n\r\nMethimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin.[A184559] Another proposed theory is that methimazole’s sulfur moiety may interact directly wi",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of methimazole in rats is 2250 mg/kg.[L8333] Signs and symptoms of methimazole overdose may include gastrointestinal distress, headache, fever, joint pain, pruritus, and edema. More serious adverse effects, such as aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis, may manifest within hours to days.[L8336,L8339] Hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, and CNS effects such as neuropathy or CNS depression/stimulation are also potential, albeit less frequent, results of ove",
    "metabolism": "Methimazole is rapidly and extensively metabolized by the liver, mainly via the CYP450 and FMO enzyme systems.[A184571,A184574] Several metabolites have been identified, though the specific enzyme isoforms responsible for their formation are not entirely clear. One of the first methimazole metabolites identified, 3-methyl-2-thiohydantoin, may contribute to antithyroid activity - its antithyroid activity has been demonstrated in rats and may explain the prolonged duration of iodination inhibition",
    "absorption": "Absorption of methimazole after oral administration is rapid and extensive,[A184514,A184541,A184499] with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 0.93[A184499] and a T<sub>max</sub> ranging from 0.25 to 4.0 hours.[A184514,A184499] C<sub>max</sub> is slightly, but not significantly, higher in hyperthyroid patients, and both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC are significantly affected by the oral dose administered.[A184514]",
    "half_life": "Following a single intravenous bolus injection of 10mg of methimazole, the t<sub>1/2</sub> of the distribution phase was 0.17 hours and the t<sub>1/2</sub> of the elimination phase was 5.3 hours.[A184499] Methimazole's primary active metabolite, 3-methyl-2-thiohydantoin, has a half-life approximately 3 times longer than its parent drug.[A184541] Renal impairment does not appear to alter the half-life of methimazole, but patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in half-life roughly proportional to the severity of their impairment - moderate insufficiency resulted in a elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> of 7.1 hours, while severe insufficiency resulted in an elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> of 22.1 hours.[A184499]\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be any significant differences in half-life based on thyroid status (i.e. no difference between euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients).[A184499,A184502,A184514]",

    "drugbank_id": "DB00829",
    "name": "Diazepam",
    "description": "A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and amnesic properties and a long duration of action. Its actions are mediated by enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid activity. It is used in the treatment of severe anxiety disorders, as a hypnotic in the short-term management of insomnia, as a sedative and premedicant, as an anticonvulsant, and in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p589)\r\n\r\nGiven diazepam's storied history as a commonly used and effective medication for a variety of indications, contemporary advancements in the formulation and administration of the agent include the development and US FDA approval of an auto-injectable formulation for the rapid treatment of uncontrolled seizures in 2015-2016 [L5200]. Combining diazepam, a proven effective therapy for acute repetitive seizures, with an auto-injector designed for subcutaneous administration that is quickly and easily administered offers the potential for complete, consistent drug absorption and rapid onset of effect [L5200]. This current development is subsequently an important addition to the rescue therapy tool chest for patients with epilepsy [L5200].",
    "indication": "In general, diazepam is useful in the symptomatic management of mild to moderate degrees of anxiety in conditions dominated by tension, excitation, agitation, fear, or aggressiveness such as may occur in psychoneurosis, anxiety reactions due to stress conditions, and anxiety states with somatic expression.[F3160]\r\n\r\nMoreover, in acute alcoholic withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, and impending acute delirium tremens.[F3160]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathologies, such as inflammation of the muscle and joints or secondary to trauma; spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders, such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia; athetosis and the rare \"stiff man syndrome\".[F3160]\r\n\r\nParticular label information from the United Kingdom also lists particular age-specific indications, including for adults: (1) The short-term relief (2-4 weeks) only, of anxiety",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle- relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects [F3157, F3160, L5188]. Most of these effects are thought to result from facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system [F3157, F3160, L5188].",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Diazepam is a benzodiazepine tranquilliser with anticonvulsant, sedative, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties [F3157, F3160, L5188].\r\n\r\nBenzodiazepines, such as diazepam, bind to receptors in various regions of the brain and spinal cord. This binding increases the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [F3157, F3160, L5188]. GABAs functions include CNS involvement in sleep induction. Also involved in the control of hypnosis, memory, anxiety, epilepsy and neuronal excitability [F3157, F3160, L5188].",
    "toxicity": "The symptoms of diazepam overdose are mainly an intensification of the therapeutic effects (ataxia, drowsiness, dysarthria, sedation, muscle weakness, profound sleep, hypotension, bradycardia, nystagmus) or paradoxical excitation [F3157, F3160, L5188]. In most cases only observation of vital functions is required [F3157, F3160, L5188].\r\n\r\nExtreme overdosage may lead to coma, areflexia, cardio-respiratory depression and apnoea, requiring appropriate countermeasures (ventilation, cardiovascular su",
    "metabolism": "Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19 to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam [F3157, F3160]. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam [F3157, F3160]. Temazepam and oxazepam are further largely eliminated by way of conjugation to glucuronic acid via glucuronidation [F3157, F3160].\r\n\r\nFurthermore, oxidation of diazepam is mediated by cytochrome P450 isozymes; formation of desmethyl-dia",
    "absorption": "After oral administration, it is considered that diazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract as  >90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 – 1.5 hours with a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours [F3157, F3160, L5188].\r\n\r\nAbsorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal [F3157]. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when fasting [F3157]. ",
    "half_life": "Diazepam has a biphasic half-life with an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase of 1 or 2 days; its action is further prolonged by the even longer half-life of 2-5 days of its principal active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam), the relative proportion of which increases in the body on long-term administration [L5188]. The plasma half-life of diazepam is prolonged in neonates, in the elderly, and in patients with kidney or liver disease [L5188].",
    "protein_binding": "Despite high binding to plasma proteins (98-99%) - mainly albumin and to a lesser extent α1-acid glycoprotein - diazepam is widely distributed into tissues and crosses the blood-brain barrier and is highly lipid soluble, which causes the initial effects to decrease rapidly as it is redistributed into fat deposits and tissues [F3157, F3160, L5188].",
    "route_of_elimination": "Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their glucuronide conjugates [F3157, F3160, L5188].",

It is effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, and has reported anxiolytic and neuroleptic properties.\r\n\r\nHaving been developed in the 1980s by GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the US FDA since January 1991, ondansetron has demonstrated a long history of use and efficacy. Commonly formulated as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and injections, and available as generic products as well, ondansetron continues to see contemporary innovations in its formulation and use, including the development of orally soluble films that are both discreet in administration and less of a burden in comparison to having patients attempt to swallow pills during emesis.[L5221]\r\n\r\nThe FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all intravenous drug products containing more than 16 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride in a single dose, due to a high risk of QT prolongation.[L44067,L43942]",
    "indication": "In the adult patient population:\r\ni) orally administered ondansetron tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) are indicated for:\r\n- the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose (ie. greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2) cisplatin therapy, and radiotherapy, and\r\n- the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting\r\n\r\nii) intravenously administered ondansetron injection formulations are indicated for:\r\n- the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose (ie. greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2) cisplatin therapy, and\r\n- the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting\r\n\r\nIn the pediatric (4-18 years of age) patient population:\r\ni) ondansetron was effective and well tolerated when given to children 4-12 years of age for the treatment of post-chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting,\r\nii) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron inj",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causin",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT3 [F3178, F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\nCytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\nAlthough the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar ",
    "toxicity": "At present, there is little information concerning overdosage with ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Nevertheless, there have been certain cases of somewhat idiosyncratic adverse effects associated with particular dosages of ondansetron used [F3178, F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\n“Sudden blindness” (amaurosis) of 2 to 3 minutes duration plus severe constipation occurred in one patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Hypotension (and faintness)",
    "metabolism": "In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little cha",
    "absorption": "Ondansetron is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some limited first-pass metabolism [F3178]. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following administration of a single 8-mg tablet, was recorded as being approximately 56% to 60% [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food [F3178].\r\n\r\nOndansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose [F3178]. The AUC from a 16-mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from a",

It is available in capsule form, tablet form, and topical form, and suppository preparations for the treatment of various infections.",
    "indication": "Metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of confirmed trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (except for in the first trimester of pregnancy) and the patient's sexual partners, bacterial vaginosis,[L7432, L49811] certain types of amebiasis, and various anaerobic infections.[A181057, L49811] The above anaerobic infections may occur on the skin and skin structures, the abdomen, the heart, reproductive organs, central nervous system, and the respiratory system. Some may also be present in the bloodstream in cases of septicemia. Common infections treated by metronidazole are Bacteroides species infections, Clostridium infections, and Fusobacterium infections, as well as Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus infections.[L3754] Topical formulations of metronidazole are indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.[L45166]\r\n\r\nIt is also used off-label in the treatment of Crohn's disease, as a prophylactic agent after surgery[A181039], and in the treatment of Helicob",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Metronidazole treats amebiasis, trichomoniasis, and giardiasis, exerting both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities.[L7432] Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections.[A181057] Metronidazole has shown antibacterial activity against the majority of obligate anaerobes, however, during in vitro studies, it does not demonstrate significant action against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes.[L3754] The nitro group reduction of metronidazole by anaerobic organisms is likely responsible for the drug's antimicrobial cytotoxic effects, causing DNA strand damage to microbes.[A181039,A181045]\r\n\r\nA note on convulsions and neuropathy and carcinogenesis\r\n\r\nIt is important to be aware of the risk of peripheral neuropathy and convulsions associated with metronidazole, especially at higher doses. If convulsions or numbness of an extremity occur, discontinue the drug immediately.[L3754] Metronidazole has been found to be carcinogenic in mice and rats. The ",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The exact mechanism of action of metronidazole has not been fully established, however, it is possible that an intermediate in the reduction of metronidazole which is only made by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, binds deoxyribonucleic acid and electron-transport proteins of organisms, blocking nucleic acid synthesis.[L3754]\r\nAfter administration, metronidazole enters cells by passive diffusion. Following this, ferredoxin or flavodoxin reduce its nitro group to nitro radicals.\r\nThe redox potential of the electron transport portions of anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms renders metronidazole selective to these organisms, which cause nitro group reduction, leading to the production of toxic metabolites. These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms.[A181039]",
    "toxicity": "LD50 information\r\n\r\nThe oral LD50 of metronidazole in rats is 5000 mg/kg [L7432]\r\n\r\nOverdose information \r\n\r\nAdverse effects that may be exaggerated with an overdose include peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system toxicity, seizures, disulfiram-like effect (if combined with alcohol) dark urine, a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, epigastric discomfort, and vertigo, in addition to neutropenia.[A181054,L7432]  There is no specific antidote for metronidazole overdose.

    "drugbank_id": "DB00924",
    "name": "Cyclobenzaprine",
    "description": "Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.",
    "indication": "Cyclobenzaprine is indicated as a short-term (2-3 weeks) adjunct therapy, along with rest and physical therapy, for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity originating from cerebral or spinal cord disease, or spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.[L8408,L8411] Cyclobenzaprine is also occasionally used off-label for reducing pain and sleep disturbances in patients with fibromyalgia.[A184946]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works on areas of the brainstem to reduce skeletal muscle spasm, though its exact pharmacodynamic behaviour is currently unclear.[L8408,L8411,A184982] Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours.[A184982] Cyclobenzaprine has been reported to contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other serotonergic medications.[L8408,L8411,A36339] Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, changes to mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms - treatment with cyclobenzaprine should be discontinued immediately if any of these reactions occur during therapy.[L8408,L8411]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The exact mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine has not been fully elucidated in humans, and much of the information available regarding its mechanism has been ascertained from early animal studies. There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature[L8411,A184982]. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity.[A184982]\r\n\r\nMore recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects.[A5896,A184982,A4862]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of cyclobenzaprine in mice and rats is 338 mg/kg and 425 mg/kg, respectively. Signs of overdose may develop rapidly after ingestion and commonly include significant drowsiness and tachycardia, with less common manifestations including tremor, agitation, ataxia, GI upset, and other CNS effects such as confusion and hallucinations. Potentially critical manifestations, though rare, include cardiac arrest or dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, seizures, and neuroleptic maligna",
    "metabolism": "Cyclobenzaprine is extensively metabolized in the liver via both oxidative and conjugative pathways.[L8408,A184940,A184982] Oxidative metabolism, mainly N-demethylation, is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (with CYP2D6 implicated to a lesser extent) and is responsible for the major metabolite desmethylcyclobenzaprine[L8408,A14914,A184982]. Cyclobenzaprine also undergoes N-glucuronidation in the liver catalyzed by UGT1A4 and UGT2B10[A184916], and has been shown to undergo enterohepatic ci",
    "absorption": "The oral bioavailability of cyclobenzaprine has been estimated to be between 0.33 and 0.55.[A184940,A185039,L8408] C<sub>max</sub> is between 5-35 ng/mL and is achieved after 4 hours (T<sub>max</sub>).[L8408,A184982] AUC over an 8 hour dosing interval was reported to be approximately 177 ng.hr/mL.[L8408]",
    "half_life": "The effective half-life of cyclobenzaprine in young healthy subjects is approximately 18 hours.[A184940,L8408,L8411] These values are extended in the elderly and those with hepatic insufficiency, with a mean effective half-life of 33.4 hours and 46.2 hours in these groups, respectively.[A184940]",
    "protein_binding": "Cyclobenzaprine is approximately 93% protein bound in plasma.[A185039] It has been identified as specifically having a high affinity for human serum albumin.[A184919]",
    "route_of_elimination": "After administration of a radio-labeled dose of cyclobenzaprine, 38-51% of radioactivity was excreted in the urine while 14-15% was excreted in the feces.[L8411] Cyclobenzaprine is highly metabolized, with only approximately 1% of this same radio-labeled dose recovered in the urine as unchanged drug",

    "name": "Acetylsalicylic acid",
    "description": "Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. Acetylsalicylic acid has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects.  This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label].  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer [A177325]. Aspirin is classified as a _non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor_ [A32682, A177268] and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others [L5968]. \r\n\r\nAcetylsalicylic acid is a very common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. It should be kept out of reach from young children, toddlers, and infants [FDA label].",
    "indication": "**Pain, fever, and inflammation**\r\n\r\nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nThe _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Other indications**\r\n\r\nASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: \r\n\r\nReducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nReducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial in",
    "pharmacodynamics": "**Effects on pain and fever**\r\n\r\nAcetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on platelet aggregation**\r\n\r\nThe inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in ",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the",
    "toxicity": "**Lethal doses**\r\n\r\nAcute oral LD50 values have been reported as over 1.0 g/kg in humans, cats, and dogs, 0.92 g/kg - 1.48 g/kg in albino rats, 1.19 g/kg in guinea pigs, 1.1 g/kg in mice, and 1.8 g/kg in rabbit models [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Acute toxicity**\r\n\r\nSalicylate toxicity is a problem that may develop with both acute and chronic salicylate exposure [A35408]. \r\nMultiple organ systems may be affected by salicylate toxicity, including the central nervous system, the pulmonary system, and the gas",
    "metabolism": "Acetylsalicylic acid is hydrolyzed in the plasma to salicylic acid.  Plasma concentrations of aspirin following after administration of the extended-release form are mostly undetectable 4-8 hours after ingestion of a single dose. Salicylic acid was measured at 24 hours following a single dose of extended-release acetylsalicylic acid [F4405].\r\n\r\nSalicylate is mainly metabolized in the liver, although other tissues may also be involved in this process [FDA label]. The major metabolites of acetylsa",
    "absorption": "Absorption is generally rapid and complete following oral administration but absorption may be variable depending on the route, dosage form, and other factors including but not limited to the rate of tablet dissolution, gastric contents, gastric emptying time, and gastric pH [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Detailed absorption information**\r\n\r\nWhen ingested orally, acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly absorbed in both the stomach and proximal small intestine. The non-ionized acetylsalicylic acid passes through the ",
    "half_life": "The half-life of ASA in the circulation ranges from 13 - 19 minutes. Blood concentrations drop rapidly after complete absorption. The half-life of the salicylate ranges between 3.5 and 4.5 hours  [FDA label].",
    "protein_binding": "50% to 90% of a normal therapeutic concentration salicylate (a main metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid [FDA label]) binds plasma proteins, particularly albumin, while acetylsalicylic acid itself binds negligibly [FDA label]. Acetylsalicylic acid has the ability to bind to and acetylate many proteins, hormones, DNA, platelets, and hemoglobin [FDA label].",
    "route_of_elimination": "Excretion of salicylates occurs mainly through the kidney, by the processes of glomerular filtration and tubular excretion, in the form of free salicylic acid, salicyluric acid, and, additionally, phenolic and acyl glucuronides [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nSalicylate can be found in the urine soon after adminis",

    "name": "Methylprednisolone",
    "description": "Methylprednisolone is a [prednisolone] derivative glucocorticoid with higher potency than [prednisone].[A188811] It was first described in the literature in the late 1950s.[A188811,A188814]\r\n\r\nMethylprednisolone was granted FDA approval on 24 October 1957.[L10785] In the outbreak of COVID-19, low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy was successful in treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia in one patient with long-term immunosuppression.[A192813] The efficacy of methylprednisolone in novel coronavirus pneumonia is being investigated further in clinical trials.[L12666]",
    "indication": "Oral and intramuscular methylprednisolone are indicated for a number of endocrine,  rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and other disorders.[L10785,L10788] Intra-articular and soft tissue injections are indicated for short term treatment of acute gouty arthritis, acute and subactute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and synovitis of osteoarthritis.[L10788] Intralesional injections are indicated for alopecia areata, discoid lupus erythematosus, keloids, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus and psoriatic plaques, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and localized hypertrophic infiltrated inflammatory lesions of granuloma annulare.[L10788]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals.[A187463] Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces.[A187463] Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.[A187463]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation.[A187463] Corticosteroids binding to the glucocorticoid receptor mediates changes in gene expression that lead to multiple downstream effects over hours to days.[A187463]\r\n\r\nGlucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination; they inhibit phospholipase A2, which decreases the formation of arachidonic acid derivatives; they inhibit NF-Kappa B and other inflammatory transcription factors; they promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.[A187463]\r\n\r\nLower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive.[A187463] High doses of glucocorticoids for an extended period bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, raising sodium levels and decreasing potassium levels.[A187463]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is >4g/kg.[L10824] The intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> in mice is 2292mg/kg and in rats is 100mg/kg.[L10824]\r\n\r\nData regarding acute overdoses of glucocorticoids are rare.[L10785,L10788] Chronic high doses of glucocorticoids can lead to the development of cataract, glaucoma, hypertension, water retention, hyperlipidemia, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, myopathy, osteoporosis, mood changes, psychosis, dermal atrophy, allergy, acne, hypertrichosis, immune suppression, ",
    "metabolism": "The metabolism of methylprednisolone is thought to be mostly mediated by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and 20-ketosteroid reductases.[A188757]",
    "absorption": "Oral methylprednisolone has 89.9% the bioavailability of oral methylprednisolone acetate, while rectal methylprednisolone has 14.2% the bioavailability.[A188802] Intravitreal methylprednisolone has a T<sub>max</sub> of 2.5h.[A188808] Approximately 1/10 of an oral or IV dose of methylprednisolone will reach the vitreous humor.[A188808] Further data regarding the absorption of methylprednisolone are not readily available.[L10785,L10788]",
    "half_life": "Methylprednisolone has a half life of 2.3h.[A188757,A188802]",
    "protein_binding": "Methylprednisolone is 76.8% protein bound in plasma and does not significantly bind to corticosteroid binding protein.[A188757] Methylprednisolone is bound to human serum albumin in plasma.[A187147]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Methylprednisolone and its metabolites have been collected in urine in humans.[A188766] A study in dogs showed 25-31% elimination in urine and 44-52% elimination in feces.[A188799]",

    "description": "Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ([GABA]) that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993.[L8717] It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures[A186277,A186143] - today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain.[A14097,A186179] Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.[A186143,A185981,L8717]. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative, [pregabalin].",
    "indication": "In the United States, gabapentin is officially indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 3 years of age and older.[L8717] In Europe, gabapentin is indicated for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 6 years of age and older and as monotherapy in patients 12 years of age and older. It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.[L8732]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant medication that inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, allowing for its use against pathologic neurotransmission such as that seen in neuropathic pain and seizure disorders.[L8717,L8732] It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats.[L8765]\r\n\r\nGabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity.

    "mechanism_of_action": "The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear.[L8717,L8720] The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the α2δ-2 subunit has also been reported).[A186179,A14097,A186277] The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming α1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons.[A186179] There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of α2δ subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia.[A14097] Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters.[A186179] It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin.[A186277]\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence tha",
    "toxicity": "The oral TDLo of gabapentin in humans is 2.86 mg/kg and the LD<sub>50</sub> in rats has been found to be >8000 mg/kg.[L8765] Symptoms of overdose are consistent with the drug's adverse effect profile and involve CNS depression (e.g. dizziness, drowsiness, slurred speech, lethargy, loss of consciousness) and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea.[L8726,L8720] Management of overdose should involve symptomatic and supportive treatment.

    "metabolism": "Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans[L8717,L8720] - in humans, metabolites account for less than 1% of an administered dose, with the remainder being excreted as unchanged parent drug in the urine.[A186143]",
    "absorption": "Absorption of gabapentin is thought to occur solely via facilitated transport by the LAT1 transporter within the intestines.[A186143] As this process is saturable, the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is inversely proportional to the administered dose - the oral bioavailability of a 900mg/day regimen is approximately 60%, whereas a 4800mg/day regimen results in only 27% bioavailability.[L8717,L8726] The T<sub>max</sub> of gabapentin has been estimated to be 2-3 hours.[L8720,A186143] Food has n",

    "description": "Salbutamol (Albuterol [USAN]) is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[Label,A174379,A174400]",

    "indication": "Glyburide is indicated alone or as part of combination product with metformin, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L8120,L8123]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Glyburide is a second generation sulfonylurea[A183722] that stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations.[A183617] Glibenclamide has a long duration of action as it is given once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as patients are started at doses as low as 0.75mg but that can increase as high as 10mg or more.[A183725,L8123] Patients taking glyburide should be cautioned regarding an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality as seen with tolbutamide, another sulfonylurea.[L8123]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Glyburide belongs to a class of drugs known as sulfonylureas.[A183617]  These drugs act by closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells.[A183617] The ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells are known as sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1).[A183617]\r\n\r\nUnder low glucose concentrations, SUR1 remains open, allowing for potassium ion efflux to create a -70mV membrane potential.[A183617]\r\n\r\nNormally SUR1 closes in response to high glucose concentrations, the membrane potential of the cells becomes less negative, the cell depolarizes, voltage gated calcium channels open, calcium ions enter the cell, and the increased intracellular calcium concentration stimulates the release of insulin containing granules.[A183617]\r\n\r\nGlyburide bypasses this process by forcing SUR1 closed and stimulating increased insulin secretion.[A183617]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is >3200mg/kg, in mice is >1500mg/kg, in rabbits is >10,000mg/kg, and in guinea pigs is >1500mg/kg.[L8135]\r\n\r\nPatients experiencing an overdose may present with hypoglycemia.[L8123] Mild hypoglycemia should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments to drug doses or meal schedules.[L8123] Severe hypoglycemia may present with coma, seizure, and neurological impairment.[L8123] This should be treated immediately in hospital with intravenous glucose and monitoring ",
    "metabolism": "Glyburide is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, followed by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A7, and CYP3A5.[A183560,A183569] These enzymes metabolize glyburide to 4-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide (M1), 4-cis-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide (M2a), 3-cis-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide (M2b), 3-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide (M3), 2-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide (M4), and ethylhydroxycyclohexyl glyburide (M5).[A183569] The M1 and M2b metabolites are considered active, along with the parent molecule.[A183569]",

    "description": "Amoxicillin, or BRL-2333, is a penicillin G derivative first described in the literature in 1972.[A190648] Amoxicillin has similar activity to [penicillin] and [ampicillin], but leads to higher serum concentrations than ampicillin.[A190648]\r\n\r\nAmoxicillin was granted FDA approval on 18 January 1974.[L11644]",
    "indication": "Amoxicillin alone is indicated to treat susceptible bacterial infections of the ear, nose, throat, genitourinary tract, skin, skin structure, and lower respiratory tract.[L11656,L11659] Amoxicillin is given with calvulanic acid to treat acute bacterial sinusitis, community acquired pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, acute bacterial otitis media, skin and skin structure infections, and urinary tract infections.[L11650,L7880,L11653] Amoxicillin is given with omeprazole in the treatment of _Helicobacter pylori_ (_H. pylori_) infection.[L9743,L11647]\r\n\r\nAmoxicillin is used in combination with [vonoprazan] and [clarithromycin] as co-packaged triple therapy or in combination with [vonoprazan] as co-packaged dual therapy to treat _H. pylori_ infection in adults.[L41695]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Amoxicillin competitively inhibit penicillin binding proteins, leading to upregulation of autolytic enzymes and inhibition of cell wall synthesis.[A6205,A190678,A190642] Amoxicillin has a long duration of action as it is usually given twice daily.[L7880] Amoxicillin has a wide therapeutic range as mild overdoses are not associated with significant toxicity.[L11650] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of anaphylaxis, _Clostridium difficile_ infections, and bacterial resistance.[L11656]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Amoxicillin competitively inhibits penicillin-binding protein 1 and other high molecular weight penicillin binding proteins.[A6205,A190678]  Penicillin bind proteins are responsible for glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase reactions that lead to cross-linking of D-alanine and D-aspartic acid in bacterial cell walls.[A190678] Without the action of penicillin binding proteins, bacteria upregulate autolytic enzymes and are unable to build and repair the cell wall, leading to bacteriocidal action.[A190642,A190678]",
    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing an overdose may present with hematuria, oliguria, abdominal pain, acute renal failure, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, hyperactivity, and drowsiness.[A190660,L11650] Treat overdose with symptomatic and supportive treatment, which may include emesis or hemodialysis.[L11650]",
    "metabolism": "Incubation with human liver microsomes has lead to the detection of 7 metabolites.[A190618] The M1 metabolite has undergone hydroxylation, M2 has undergone oxidative deamination, M3 to M5 have undergone oxidation of the aliphatic chain, M6 has undergone decarboxylation, and M7 has undergone glucuronidation.[A190618]",
    "absorption": "Amoxicillin is approximately 60% bioavailable.[A190675] A 250mg dose of oral amoxicillin reaches a C<sub>max</sub> 3.93±1.13mg/L with a T<sub>max</sub> 1.31±0.33h and an AUC of 27.29±4.72mg\\*h/L.[A190630] A 875mg dose of oral amoxicillin reaches a C<sub>max</sub> 11.21±3.42mg/L with a T<sub>max</sub> 1.52±0.40h and an AUC of 55.04±12.68mg\\*h/L.[A190630]",

    "description": "Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was first introduced in 1984 [A179491] and is available in various countries including Canada and the U.S. According to the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines by Diabetes Canada, sulfonylurea drugs are considered a second-line glucose-lowering therapy following metformin.[L6712] Because sulfonylureas require functional pancreatic beta cells for their therapeutic effectiveness, sulfonylureas are more commonly used for early-stage type 2 diabetes when there is no progressed pancreatic failure.[T28] Compared to the first-generation sulfonylureas, such as [tolbutamide] and [chlorpropamide], second-generation sulfonylureas contain a more non-polar side chain in their chemical structure, which enhances their hypoglycemic potency.[A179488] Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents.[A179485] Glipizide was first approved by the FDA in 1994 and is available in extended-release tablets under the brand name Glucotrol®, as well as in combination with metformin under the brand name Metaglip®.",

    "pharmacodynamics": "Glipizide is a blood glucose-lowering agent. The initial onset of blood glucose-lowering effect occurs around 30 minutes post-administration with the duration of action lasting for about 12 to 24 hours.[L6739] While the chronic use of glipizide does not result in elevations in the fasting insulin levels over time, the postprandial insulin response, or insulin response to a meal, is observed to be enhanced, even after 6 months of treatment.[label] The main therapeutic actions of glipizide primarily occur at the pancreas where the insulin release is stimulated, but glipizide also mediates some extrapancreatic effects, such as the promotion of insulin signaling effects on the muscles, fat, or liver cells.[L6745] Due to its action on the endogenous cells, sulfonylureas including glipizide is associated with a risk for developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients receiving the drug.[A179554,T28] Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea rec",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide. Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, T2DM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of T2DM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin.[A179554] Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality.",

These are symptoms of severe hypoglycemia and require immediate treatment with glucagon or intravenous glucose and clo",
    "metabolism": "Glipizide is subject to hepatic metabolism, in which its major metabolites are formed from aromatic hydroxylation. These major metabolites are glipizide are reported to be pharmacologically inactive. In contrast, an acetylaminoethyl benzine derivative is formed as a minor metabolite which accounts for less than 2% of the initial dose and is reported to have one-tenth to one-third as much hypoglycemic activity as the parent compound.[label]",
    "absorption": "Gastrointestinal absorption of glipizide is uniform, rapid, and essentially complete.[A179485] The absolute bioavailability of glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving a single oral dose was 100%.

The steady-state plasma concentrations of glipizide from extended-release oral formulations are maintained over the 24-hour dosing interval.[label] In healthy volunteers, the absorpti",

    "indication": "Clonazepam is indicated as monotherapy or as an adjunct in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic, and myoclonic seizures.[FDA Label][F3787] Furthermore, clonazepam may also be of some value in patients with absence spells (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.[FDA Label][F3787] Additionally, clonazepam is also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in the DSM-V.[FDA Label]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, some regional prescribing information note that clonazepam is indicated for all clinical forms of epileptic disease and seizures in adults, especially absence seizures (petit mal) including atypical absence; primary or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic (grand mal), tonic or clonic seizures; partial (focal) seizures with elementary or complex symptomatology; various forms of myoclonic seizures, myoclonus and associated abnormal movements.[L5572,F3796] Such regional label data also has clonazepam indic",
    "pharmacodynamics": "The pharmacodynamic properties of clonazepam are common among benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects [A175423, L5572, F3763, F3787]. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absence seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations, as well as irregular spikes and waves [FDA Label] [A175423, L5572, F3763, F3787]. Moreover, the agent can also decrease the frequency, amplitude, duration, and spread of discharge in minor motor seizures [FDA Label] [F3763].\r\n\r\nGeneralized EEG abnormalities are more readily suppressed by clonazepam than are focal EEG abnormalities such as focal spikes [L5572]. Clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies [L5572].",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175423, A175438, A175441]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, benzodiazepines like clonazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787, L5572, F3763]. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787, L5572",
    "toxicity": "Benzodiazepines like clonazepam commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Overdose with clonazepam is generally not life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression, and coma. Coma, if it does occur, usually lasts a few hours but it can become more protracted and cyclical, especially in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzo",
    "metabolism": "Clonazepam is metabolized principally in the liver [F3763, F3796]. The metabolic pathways include hydroxylation, reduction of the nitro groups to amine groups, and the addition of acetate to the amino grouping [F3763, F3796]. In particular, clonazepam is extensively metabolized by reduction to 7-amino-clonazepam and by N-acetylation to 7-acetamido-clonazepam [F3763, F3796]. Hydroxylation at the C-3 position also occurs [F3763, F3796]. Hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 is implicated in the nitroreducti",
    "absorption": "Clonazepam is rapidly and almost entirely absorbed after oral administration as tablets [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. Peak plasma concentrations of clonazepam administered by the oral route are reached within 1-4 hours and the associated absorption half-life is about 25 minutes [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 90% - but with substantially large differences between individuals [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796].",
    "half_life": "The mean elimination half-life determined for clonazepam is independent of the dose given and has been documented as being about 30-40 hours [F3763, F3796].",
    "protein_binding": "The recorded plasma protein binding of clonazepam ranges between 82–86% [F3763, F3796].",
    "route_of_elimination": "Approximately 50-70% of a clonazepam dose is excreted in the urine and 10-30% is excreted in the feces as metabolites [F3763, F3796]. The excretion of unchanged clonazepam in the urine is typically less than 2% of the administered dose [F3763, F3796]. Metabolites of clonazepam are present in urine a",

    "description": "Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), is a lipid-lowering drug included in the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nAtorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need",
    "indication": "Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications.[A177397]\r\n\r\nDyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025] \r\n\r\nAtorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]\r\n\r\nAtorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with ty",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] \r\n\r\nElevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). \r\n\r\n_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include imp",

    "name": "Sertraline",
    "description": "Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as [Citalopram] and [Fluoxetine]. Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks of therapy with sertraline may be required before beneficial effects are noticed. Sertraline displays enhanced safety or tolerability than other classes of antidepressants, which frequently cause high levels of drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other undesirable effects.[A1846,A187075,T28]",
    "indication": "Sertraline is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD).[L9016] Common off-label uses for sertraline include the prevention of post stroke depression[A187078], generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, premature ejaculation, migraine prophylaxis, diabetic neuropathy, and neurocardiogenic syncope.[L5227]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Sertraline improves or relieves the symptoms of depression, OCD, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake.[A187075,L9016] Clinical studies have shown that it improves cognition in depressed patients.[A1846] It has less sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular effects than the tricyclic antidepressant drugs because it does not exert significant anticholinergic, antihistamine, or adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta) blocking activity.[A1844] The onset of action and beneficial effects are usually noticed after 4-6 weeks, for reasons that are not fully understood and currently under investigation.[A188493,L10677]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Sertraline selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, thereby increasing serotonergic activity. This results in an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS, which leads to numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission.[T28,L9016] These changes are believed to be responsible for the antidepressant action and beneficial effects in obsessive-compulsive (and other anxiety related disorders). It has been hypothesized that obsessive-compulsive disorder, like depression, is also caused by the disregulation of serotonin.[A187165]\r\n\r\nIn animal studies, chronic administration of sertraline results in down-regulation of brain norepinephrine receptors.[L9016] Sertraline displays affinity for sigma-1 and 2 receptor binding sites[A31941], but binds with stronger affinity to sigma-1 binding sites.[A31940] In vitro, sertraline shows little to no affinity for GABA, dopaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5",

Most fatal cases are associated with the ingestion o",
    "metabolism": "Sertraline is heavily metabolized in the liver and has one major active metabolite. It undergoes N-demethylation to form N-desmethylsertraline, which is much less potent in its pharmacological activity than sertraline.[A187066] In addition to N-demethylation, sertraline metabolism involves N-hydroxylation, oxidative deamination, and finally, glucuronidation.[L9016] The metabolism of sertraline is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, with some activity accounted for by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.[A1846",
    "absorption": "Following once-daily administration of 50 to 200 mg for two weeks, the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours after administration, and measured at 20 to 55 μg/L.[A1846,L9016] Steady-state concentrations are reached after 1 week following once-daily administration, and vary greatly depending on the patient.[A187066,L9016] Bioavailability has been estimated to be above 44%.

    "name": "Pioglitazone",
    "description": "Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11416,L11419,L11422,L11425] It is administered as a racemic mixture, though there is no pharmacologic difference between the enantiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence.[L11416] The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes [rosiglitazone] and [troglitazone], exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose[L11416] via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).[A19757] PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes and affect numerous metabolic processes, most notably lipid and glucose homeostasis.[A19759]\r\n\r\nThiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, have fallen out of favor in recent years due to the presence of multiple adverse effects and warnings regarding their use (e.g. congestive heart failure, bladder cancer) and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11461]",
    "indication": "Pioglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11416] It is also available in combination with [metformin],[L11419] [glimepiride],[L11422] or [alogliptin][L11425] for the same indication.",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves impaired glucose homeostasis.[A19757] In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, these effects result in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values.[A19757]\r\n \r\nSignificant fluid retention leading to the development/exacerbation of congestive heart failure has been reported with pioglitazone - avoid its use in patients in heart failure or at risk of developing heart failure.[L11416] There is some evidence that pioglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer.[L11416]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Pioglitazone is a selective agonist at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver.[L11416,A19759] Activation of PPARγ increases the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid production, transport, and utilization.[A19759] Through this mechanism, pioglitazone both enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin and reduces the hepatic production of glucose (i.e. gluconeogenesis) - insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is therefore improved without an increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells.[L11416,A19759]",
    "toxicity": "The oral TDLo observed in mice is 24 mg/kg for 4 days and for rats is 3 mg/kg for 6 days.[L11431]\r\n\r\nOne instance of overdose was reported during clinical trials with pioglitazone in which a patient took an oral dose of 120mg daily for four days, followed by 180mg daily for seven days[L11416] - this patient did not report any adverse clinical symptoms during this time. In the event of overdosage, employ symptomatic and supportive measures according to the patient's clinical status.[L11416]",
    "metabolism": "Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized by both hydroxylation and oxidation -  the resulting metabolites are also partly converted to glucuronide or sulfate conjugates.[L11416] The pharmacologically active M-IV and M-III metabolites are the main metabolites found in human serum and their circulating concentrations are equal to, or greater than, those of the parent drug.[A415] The specific CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone are CYP2C8 and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4. There ",
    "absorption": "Following oral administration of pioglitazone, peak serum concentrations are observed within 2 hours (T<sub>max</sub>) - food slightly delays the time to peak serum concentration, increasing T<sub>max</sub> to approximately 3-4 hours, but does not alter the extent of absorption.[L11416] Steady-state concentrations of both parent drug and its primary active metabolites are achieved after 7 days of once-daily administration of pioglitazone.[L11416] C<sub>max</sub> and AUC increase proportionately ",
    "half_life": "The mean serum half-life of pioglitazone and its metabolites (M-III and M-IV) range from 3-7 hours and 16-24 hours, respectively.[L11416]",
    "protein_binding": "Pioglitazone is >99% protein-bound in human plasma - binding is primarily to albumin, although pioglitazone has been shown to bind other serum proteins with a lower affinity.[L11416] The M-III and M-IV metabolites of pioglitazone are >98% protein-bound (also primarily to albumin).[L11416]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Approximately 15-30% of orally administered pioglitazone is recovered in the urine. The bulk of its elimination, then, is presumed to be through the excretion of unchanged drug in the bile or as metabolites in the feces.[L11416]",

    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing an overdose may present with hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.[L7889,L7892] Patients should remain in a supine position and may be given atropine for bradycardia and glucagon followed by sympathomimetics to support cardiovascular function.[L7889,L7892]",

    "description": "Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin®) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]\r\n\r\nBupropion was originally classified as an \"atypical\" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]\r\n\r\nWhen used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates appro",
    "indication": "Bupropion is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and as an aid to smoking cessation. \r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with [naltrexone] as the marketed product ContraveⓇ, bupropion is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of: 30 kg/m^2 or greater (obese) or 27 kg/m^2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).\r\n\r\nBupropion is also used off-label as a first-line treatment in patients with ADHD and comorbid bipolar disorder when used as an adjunct to mood stabilizers.[F4624]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Bupropion is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other known antidepressant agents. Compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. In addition, Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Bupropion has been found to be essentially inactive at the serotonin transporter (SERT)(IC50 >10 000 nM),[A178810] however both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion have been found to block the function of cation-selective serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs). \r\n\r\nBupropion produces dose-related central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects in animals, as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, increased rates of responding in various schedule-controlled operant behaviour tasks, and, at high doses, induction of mild stereotyped behaviour [FDA Label]. Due to these stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norep",

Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion.

    "description": "Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the S-enantiomer of racemic [citalopram].[A185420] It is used to restore serotonergic function in the treatment of depression and anxiety.[L8513,L8516,L8522] Escitalopram is approximately 150 times more potent than citalopram’s R-enantiomer and is responsible for the vast majority of citalopram’s clinical activity, with some evidence suggesting that the R-enantiomer of racemic citalopram actively dampens the activity of escitalopram rather than existing simply as an inactive enantiomer.[A39738,A185819] Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class.[A185726] Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs.[A185825,A185726,A185822]",
    "indication": "Escitalopram is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years old and older and for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults and pediatric patients 7 years old and older.[L8513,L8513] It is additionally indicated for symptomatic relief of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in Canada.[L8516]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These agents cause an increase in serotonin levels in neuronal synapses by preventing the re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT) into the presynaptic terminals of serotonergic neurons.[A185420,A39738,L8513,L8516] As compared to other SSRIs, it appears to have a relatively quick onset of effect due to its potency.[A185819,A185822]\r\n\r\nSSRIs as a class have been associated with abnormal bleeding, particularly in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other medications affecting hemostasis, and with the development of serotonin syndrome. Use escitalopram with caution in patients with a higher-than-baseline risk of bleeding and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other serotonergic drugs. Escitalopram may also cause a discontinuation syndrome with abrupt removal of the drug, and should be slowly tapered if discontinuation of therapy is warranted.[L8513,L8516,L8522]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Escitalopram, like other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, enhances serotonergic activity by binding to the orthosteric (i.e. primary) binding site on the serotonin transporter (SERT), the same site to which endogenous 5-HT binds, and thus prevents the re-uptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron.[A185420,A39738,A185726] Escitalopram, along with [paroxetine], is also considered an allosteric serotonin re-uptake inhibitor - it binds to a secondary allosteric site on the SERT molecule to more strongly inhibit 5-HT re-uptake. Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. [A185825,A185726] The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical e",
    "toxicity": "Symptoms of overdose may include CNS effects (dizziness, convulsions, coma, somnolence), gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting), and/or cardiac abnormalities (hypotension, tachycardia, ECG changes).[L8513,L8516,L8522] There is no specific antidote for escitalopram overdose. Management of overdose should focus on monitoring for cardiac abnormalities and changes to vital signs as well as treatment with supportive measures as indicated. As escitalopram is highly distributed into tissue follow",
    "metabolism": "The metabolism of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, mediated primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6. Oxidative N-demethylation by the CYP enzyme system results in S-desmethylcitalopram (S-DCT) and S-didesmethylcitalopram (S-DDCT) - these metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of escitalopram, and exist in the plasma in small quantities relative to the parent compound (28-31% and <5%, respectively).[L8513,L8516,L8522]\r\n\r\nThere is also some evidence that",
    "absorption": "Absorption of escitalopram following oral administration is expected to be almost complete, with an estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 80%. T<sub>max</sub> occurs after about 4-5 hours.[L8513,L8516,L8522] C<sub>max</sub> and AUC appear to follow dose proportionality - at steady state, patients receiving 10mg of escitalopram daily had a C<sub>max</sub> of 21 ng/mL and a 24h AUC of approximately 360 ng*h/mL, while patients receiving 30mg daily had a roughly 3-fold increase in both",
    "half_life": "The elimination half-life of escitalopram is 27-32 hours, though this is increased by approximately 50% in the elderly and doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function.[A185420,L8513,L8516,L8522] The elimination half-life of escitalopram's primary metabolite, S-desmethylcitalopram, is approximately 54 hours at steady state.[A39738]",
    "protein_binding": "Escitalopram exhibits relatively low protein binding at approximately 55-56%.[L8513,L8516,L8522,A39738]",
    "route_of_elimination": "After oral administration of escitalopram, approximately 8% of the total dose is eliminated in the urine as unchanged escitalopram and 10% is eliminated in the urine as S-desmethylcitalopram.[L8513,L8516,L8522] The apparent hepatic clearance of escitalopram amounts to approximately 90% of the total ",

    "toxicity": "Acute overdose of corticosteroids is rare, however prolonged high dosing of corticosteroids can lead to hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression.[L10601,L10604,L10607,L10613,L10619,L10622,L10625] In the case of overdose, reduce the dosage of corticosteroids temporarily.[L10601,L10604,L10607,L10613,L10619,L10622,L10625]\r\n\r\nA 200mg oral dose is lethal to female mice while a 400mg oral dose is lethal to male mice.[L10601,L10604,L10622]",
    "metabolism": "Budesonide is 80-90% metabolized at first pass.[A188526] Budesonide is metabolized by CYP3A to its 2 major metabolites, 6beta-hydroxybudesonide and 16alpha-hydroxyprednisolone.[A188526,A35818] The glucocorticoid activity of these metabolites is negligible (<1/100) in relation to that of the parent compound.[A188526] CYP3A4 is the strongest metabolizer of budesonide, followed by CYP3A5, and CYP3A7.[A35818]",

    "description": "Initially approved by the FDA in 1997, quetiapine is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic used in schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder.[L8546] Quetiapine demonstrates a high level of therapeutic efficacy and low risk of adverse effects during long-term treatment. It is well-tolerated and a suitable option for some patients with high sensitivity to other drugs, such as [clozapine] and [olanzapine].[A2189]",
    "indication": "Quetiapine is used in the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia.  In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. It may be used to manage depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression.[L8546]\r\n\r\nSome off-label uses for this drug include the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease.[A185438,A185447,T685]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Quetiapine improves the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and major depression by acting on various neurotransmitter receptors, such as the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In bipolar disorder, it improves both depressive and manic symptoms.[A2189,A185441,A185444]\r\n\r\n**A note on suicidality in young patients and administration in the elderly**\r\n\r\nQuetiapine can cause suicidal thinking or behavior in children and adolescents and should not be given to children under 10 years of age. It is important to monitor for suicidality if this drug is given to younger patients. In addition, this drug is not indicated for the treatment of psychosis related to dementia due to an increased death rate in elderly patients taking this drug.[L8546]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Although the mechanism of action of quetiapine is not fully understood, several proposed mechanisms exist. In schizophrenia, its actions could occur from the antagonism of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. In bipolar depression and major depression, quetiapine's actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter. Additional effects of quetiapine, including somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, may result from the antagonism of H1 receptors, adrenergic α1 receptors, and muscarinic M1 receptors, respectively.[A2189,A185438,L8546]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD50 if quetiapine in rats is 2000 mg/kg.[L8594]\r\n\r\n**Overdose information**\r\n\r\nSome signs and symptoms of a quetiapine overdose include sedation, drowsiness, tachycardia, and hypotension. Clinical trials demonstrate that overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine did not result in death. A lethal outcome was reported in a clinical trial after an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine.  In the case of an acute overdose, ensure to maintain an airway and provide adequate ventilation and oxyg",
    "metabolism": "The metabolism of quetiapine occurs mainly in the liver. Sulfoxidation and oxidation are the main metabolic pathways of this drug. According to in vitro studies, cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolizes quetiapine to an inactive sulfoxide metabolite and also participates in the metabolism of its active metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine. CYP2D6 also regulates the metabolism of quetiapine. In one study, three metabolites of N-desalkylquetiapine were identified. Two of the metabolites were identified as N-d",

    "description": "Diabetic gastroparesis is a condition that causes frequent nausea and vomiting, which has a negative impact on quality of life and poses a significant burden on the healthcare system.[A184934] Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting that may be associated with diabetic gastroparesis in addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It can also be used to prevent nausea or vomiting associated with chemotherapy or certain surgical or diagnostic procedures.[L8417] \r\n\r\nOne unique property of this drug is that it does not increase gastric acid secretion. It is available in the oral tablet form or in solution, and can also be administered through the intravenous route.[T683] Metoclopramide was initially approved by the FDA in 1980.[A184922]",
    "indication": "Metoclopramide in the oral tablet form is used for symptomatic treatment of both acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, in addition to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who have failed to respond to traditional therapy.[L8414] A nasal spray formulation is also indicated to treat adults with acute, recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.[L14381]\r\n\r\nIn the intravenous injection form, it is indicated for the above conditions as well as for the prevention of vomiting that may follow emetogenic chemotherapy or nausea and vomiting after surgery. Intravenous metoclopramide facilitates intubation of the small bowel and stimulates gastric emptying and barium flow in patients who require radiological examination of the stomach or small intestine.  In some cases, the delay of gastrointestinal emptying interferes with the radiographic visualization of the gastrointestinal tract, and metoclopramide is used to facilitate emptying in these cases, allowing for adequate",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Metoclopramide increases gastric emptying by decreasing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. It also exerts effects on the area postrema of the brain, preventing and relieving the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. In addition, this drug increases gastrointestinal motility without increasing biliary, gastric, or pancreatic secretions.[T683,L8414,L8417]\r\n\r\nBecause of its antidopaminergic activity, metoclopramide can cause symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), dystonia, and akathisia, and should therefore not be administered for longer than 12 weeks.[A184886,L8414]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Metoclopramide causes antiemetic effects by inhibiting dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) located in the area postrema of the brain.[A184880,T683] Administration of this drug leads to prokinetic effects via inhibitory actions on presynaptic and postsynaptic D2 receptors, agonism of serotonin 5-HT4 receptors, and antagonism of muscarinic receptor inhibition. This action enhances the release of acetylcholine, causing increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and gastric tone, accelerating gastric emptying and transit through the gut. Metoclopramide antagonizes the dopamine D2 receptors. Dopamine exerts relaxant effect on the gastrointestinal tract through binding to muscular D2 receptors.[A184880,T683,L8414]",
    "toxicity": "The rat oral LD50 of metoclopramide is 750 mg/kg.[L8465]\r\n\r\nSome symptoms of an overdose with metoclopramide include drowsiness, disorientation, and extrapyramidal reactions. Drugs that manage Parkinson's disease or anticholinergic drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties [A185174] should be employed to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. Normally, these symptoms subside within 24 hours.[L8414] Unintentional overdose in infants receiving the oral solution of metoclopramide resulted in ",
    "metabolism": "Metoclopramide undergoes first-pass metabolism and its metabolism varies according to the individual. This drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver.[A184880] CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 both contribute to its metabolism, with CYP2D6 being more heavily involved. CYP1A2 is also a minor contributing enzyme.[A181352] The process of N-4 sulphate conjugation is a primary metabolic pathway of metoclopramide.[A184886]",
    "absorption": "Metoclopramide is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract with an absorption rate of about 84%.[A184886] The bioavailability of the oral preparation is reported to be about 40.7%, but can range from 30-100%.[A184880,A184949]\r\n\r\nNasal metoclopramide is 47% bioavailable.[L14381] A 15mg dose reaches a C<sub>max</sub> of 41.0 ng/mL, with a T<sub>max</sub> of 1.25 h, and an AUC of 367 ng\\*h/mL.[L14381]",
    "half_life": "The mean elimination half-life of metoclopramide in people with healthy renal function ranges from 5 to 6 hours but is prolonged in patients with renal impairment. Downward dose adjustment should be considered.[A184886,A185153,L8414]",

    "description": "Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autism, and Tourette's.[L45859] It is also indicated as an injection for agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania.[L45859] Aripiprazole exerts its effects through agonism of dopaminergic and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors.[L45859,A4393] Aripiprazole was given FDA approval on November 15, 2002.[L6136]",
    "indication": "Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette's disorder.[L45859] It is also used as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.[L45859 An injectable formulation of aripiprazole is indicated for agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania.[L45859] Finally, an extended-release, bimonthly injection formulation of aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of adult schizophrenia and maintenance therapy for adult bipolar I disorder.[L46203]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>, serotonin 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2a</sub> receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, serotonin 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic and histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki=98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC<sub>50</sub>>1000 nM).[L45859]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The antipsychotic action of aripiprazole is likely due to its partial agonist activity on D2 and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors as well as its antagonist activity at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors; however, the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated.[A4393,L45859,L4620] One of the mechanisms that have been proposed is that aripiprazole both stimulates and inhibits dopamine as it engages the D2 receptor. It lowers dopamine neuronal firing at high dopamine concentrations and increases dopamine firing at low concentrations. Its partial agonist activity gives aripiprazole an intermediate level of dopaminergic neuronal tone between full agonist and antagonist of the D2 receptor.[A258699] In addition, some adverse effects may be due to action on other receptors.[L4620] For example, orthostatic hypotension may be explained by antagonism of the adrenergic alpha-1 receptors.[L4620,A4393]",
    "toxicity": "Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY, during the third trimester of  pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major",
    "metabolism": "Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in systemic circulation. At steady-state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.[L45859]",
    "absorption": "Tablet: Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 hours to 5 hours; the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%. ABILIFY can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 15 mg ABILIFY tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C<sub>max</sub> or AUC of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, but delayed T<sub>max</sub> by 3 hours for aripi",
    "half_life": "The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively.[L45859] For populations that are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, the half-life of aripiprazole is 146 hours and these patients should be treated with half the normal dose.[L45859] Other studies have reported a half-life of 61.03±19.59 hours for aripiprazole and 279±299 hours for the active metabolite.[A177904]",
    "protein_binding": "At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin.[L45859]",
    "route_of_elimination": "Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged ",

The effect of this medication leads to glucose dependent increases in insulin and decreases in glucagon to improve control of blood sugar[FDA label,A2255]. Sitagliptin was granted FDA approval on October 16, 2006[L6061].",
    "indication": "Sitagliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or patients with a history of pancreatitis.[L41220]\r\n\r\nIt is also used in combination with [metformin] [L41215] or [ertugliflozin].[L41225]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4 which leads to increased levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP), decreased levels of glucagon, and a stronger insulin response to glucose[FDA label,A2260,A2255,A2256].",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Inhibition of DPP-4 by sitagliptin slows DPP-4 mediated inactivation of incretins like GLP-1 and GIP[FDA label,A2256]. Incretins are released throughout the day and upregulated in response to meals as part of glucose homeostasis[FDA label,A2260]. Reduced inhibition of incretins increase insulin synthesis and decrease glucagon release in a manner dependant on glucose concentrations[FDA label,A2255]. These effects lead to an overall increase in blood glucose control which is demonstrated by reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)[FDA label,A2260].",
    "toxicity": "Animal studies in pregnancy have shown no adverse effects on the mother or offspring at normal doses, however these results are not always applicable to humans. There is a voluntary fetal exposure registry [FDA label,L6067]. Animal studies at 100 times the maximum recommended human dose resulted in an increase in rib malformations. Sitagliptin is excreted in the milk of rats but it is not known if it would also be expressed in human breast milk. Because many drugs are expressed in human breast m",
    "metabolism": "Sitagliptin is mostly not metabolised, with 79% of the dose excreted in the urine as the unchanged parent compound[FDA label].

After 18 hours, 81% of the dose has remained unchanged, while 2% has been N-sulfated to the M1 metabolite, 6% has been  oxidatively desaturated and cyclized to the M2 metabolite, <1% glucuronidated at an unknown site to the M3 metabolite, <1% has been carb",
    "absorption": "Sitagliptin is 87% orally bioavailable and taking it with or without food does not affect its pharmacokinetics[FDA label,A2260]. Sitagliptin reaches maximum plasma concentration in 2 hours[A2260].",

Secondly, it is an oral agent whereas the widely used unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins are for parenteral use only. Although the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest (a test developed to assay low molecular weight heparins) are prolonged in a dose-dependant manner, neither test is recommended for the assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban. Anti-Xa activity and inhibition of anti-Xa activity monitoring is also not recommended despite being influenced by rivaroxaban.",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits free and clot bound factor Xa. Factor Xa is needed to activate prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa). Thrombin is a serine protease that is required to activate fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the loose meshwork that completes the clotting process. Since one molecule of factor Xa can generate more than 1000 molecules of thrombin, selective inhibitors of factor Xa are profoundly useful in terminating the amplification of thrombin generation. The action of rivaroxaban is irreversible.",
    "toxicity": "Excessive bleeding. Overdosages should be treated using activated charcoal and supportive measures such as mechanical compression and hemodynamic support. If bleeding is not controlled, the following procoagulants can be administered: activated prothrombin complex concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate and recombinant factor VIIa. There is also a higher chance of post procedural hemorrhage compared to enoxaparin (1.55% vs. 1.39% respectively).",

It is marketed under the name Eliquis[Label,L6043]. Apixaban was approved by the FDA on December 28, 2012[L6043].",
    "indication": "Apixaban is indicated for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis(DVT) leading to pulmonary embolism(PE) in patients after a hip or knee replacement surgery, and treatment of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of recurrence[Label,A177565,A6897].",

    "toxicity": "Animal studies have shown an increased risk of maternal bleeding during pregnancy but no increase in fetal malformations or fetal or maternal deaths[Label]. It is unknown if this animal data also translates to humans so apixaban should only be used in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks[Label]. It is not know whether apixaban is safe and effective in labor and during birth, though animal studies have shown an increased rate of maternal bleeding[Label]. Animal studies in rats show apixab",
    "metabolism": "50% of the orally administered dose is excreted as the unchanged parent compound, however 25% of the dose is excreted as O-demethyl apixaban sulfate[Label,A177565]. All apixaban metabolites account for approximately 32% of the excreted dose though the structure of all metabolites are not well defined[A177565]. Apixaban is mainly metabolized by cytochrome p450(CYP)3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2J2[Label].",

    "description": "Victoza contains liraglutide, a synthetic analog of human glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist.[Label,A6932] Liraglutide is 97% similar to native human GLP-1, differing primarily by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34.[A6932] Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor.[A6932] Liraglutide was granted FDA approval on January 25, 2010.[L6070]",
    "indication": "Saxenda, a formulation of liraglutide intended for weight loss, is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise for chronic weight management in adult patients who are obese (BMI≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), or who are overweight (BMI≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and have at least one weight-related comorbidity. It is also indicated for chronic weight management in pediatric patients ≥12 years old who weigh ≥60 kg and have an initial BMI corresponding to obesity based on international cut-offs.[L38839]\r\n\r\nVictoza, a formulation of liraglutide used in diabetes, is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients ≥10 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.[L38839]\r\n\r\nLiraglutide is also available in combination with [insulin degludec] as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patie",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Liraglutide is a once-daily GLP-1 derivative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes[Label,A177673]. The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a fatty acid molecule at position 26 of the GLP-1 molecule, enabling it to bind reversibly to albumin within the subcutaneous tissue and bloodstream and be released slowly over time[Label,A177673,A6930]. Binding with albumin results in slower degradation and reduced elimination of liraglutide from the circulation by the kidneys compared to GLP-1[A177673,A6930]. The effect of liraglutide is the increased secretion of insulin and decreased secretion of glucagon in response to glucose as well as slower gastric emptying[Label]. Liraglutide also does not adversely affect glucagon secretion in response to low blood sugar[Label,A177673].",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Liraglutide is an acylated synthetic glucagon-like peptide-1 analog[Label,A6932,A177673]. Liraglutide is an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor which is coupled to adenylate cyclase[Label]. The increase in cyclic AMP stimulates the glucose dependant release of insulin, inhibits the glucose dependant release of glucagon, and slows gastric emptying to increase control of blood sugar[Label,A6930].",
    "toxicity": "There is no clinical significance of race or ethnicity on the safety or efficacy of liraglutide[Label]. Geriatric patients do not experience clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetics though patients at an especially advanced age may be more susceptible to adverse effects[Label]. Female patients have reduced clearance of liraglutide but no dose adjustment is necessary[Label]. The risk and benefit of liraglutide in pregnancy must be weighed before prescribing[Label]. In animal studies",
    "metabolism": "Liraglutide is less sensitive to metabolism than the endogenous GLP-1 and so is more slowly metabolized by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and neutral endopeptidase to various smaller polypeptides which have not all been structurally determined[A6932]. A portion of Liraglutide may be completely metabolized to carbon dioxide and water[A6932].",
    "absorption": "Bioavailability of liraglutide after subcutaneous injection is approximately 55%[Label] and maximum concentrations are reached after 11.7 hours[A6932].",
    "half_life": "Terminal half life of 13 hours[A6932].",

    "description": "Canagliflozin, also known as _Invokana_, is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus along with lifestyle changes including diet and exercise [FDA label].\r\n\r\nIt was initially approved by the FDA in 2013 for the management of diabetes and later approved in 2018 for a second indication of reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [L5897], [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nCanagliflozin is the first oral antidiabetic drug approved for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes [L5897]. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in these patients [A177083].",
    "indication": "This drug is used in conjunction with diet and exercise to increase glycemic control in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [FDA label].\r\n\r\nAnother indication for canagliflozin is the prevention of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death due to a cardiovascular cause) in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes[L5897,[L8917].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, canagliflozin can be used to lower the risk of end-stage kidney disease and major increases in serum creatinine and cardiovascular death for patients with a combination of type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, and albuminuria.[L8917]\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this drug is **not** indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis [FDA label].",
    "pharmacodynamics": "This drug increases urinary glucose excretion and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG) in a dose-dependent manner [FDA label]. The renal threshold is defined as the lowest level of blood glucose associated with the appearance of detectable glucose in the urine [A176969, T545].  The end result of canagliflozin administration is increased urinary excretion of glucose and less renal absorption of glucose, decreasing glucose concentration in the blood and improving glycemic control. \r\n\r\n**A note on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease**\r\n\r\nThe risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes type 2 is increased due to the damaging effects of diabetes on blood vessels and nerves in the cardiovascular system.  In particular, there is a tendency for hyperglycemia to create pro-atherogenic (plaque forming) lesions in blood vessels, leading to various fatal and non-fatal events including stroke and myocardial infarction [A177086, L5933].  Long-term glycemic control has been proven to ",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The sodium-glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2), is found in the proximal tubules of the kidney, and reabsorbs filtered glucose from the renal tubular lumen. Canagliflozin inhibits the SGLT2 co-transporter. This inhibition leads to lower reabsorption of filtered glucose into the body and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine [FDA label].",
    "toxicity": "**Overdose information**\r\n\r\nIf an overdose occurs, contact the Poison Control Center. Normal supportive measures should be taken, including the removal unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract, initiating clinical monitoring of the patient, and providing supportive treatment as deemed necessary. Canagliflozin has been removed in very small quantities after a 4-hour hemodialysis session. This drug is likely not dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis [FDA label].\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pregnancy and lactation**",
    "metabolism": "Canagliflozin is primarily metabolized by O-glucuronidation. It is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 enzymes to two inactive O-glucuronide metabolites [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nThe oxidative metabolism of canagliflozin by hepatic cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4 is negligible (about 7%) in humans [FDA label].",
    "absorption": "**Bioavailability and steady-state**\r\n\r\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of canagliflozin, on average, is approximately 65% [FDA label]. Steady-state concentrations are achieved after  4 to 5 days of daily dose administration between the range of 100mg to 300mg [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Effect of food on absorption** \r\n\r\nCo-administration of a high-fat meal with canagliflozin exerted no appreciable effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of canagliflozin. This drug may be administered without regard t",
    "half_life": "In a clinical study, the terminal half-life of canagliflozin was 10.6 hours for the 100mg dose and 13.1 hours for the 300 mg dose [FDA label].",
    "protein_binding": "Canagliflozin is mainly bound to albumin. The plasma protein binding of this drug is 99% [FDA label].",
    "route_of_elimination": "After a single oral radiolabeled dose canagliflozin dose to healthy subjects, the following ratios of canagliflozin or metabolites were measured in the feces and urine [FDA label]:\r\n\r\n**Feces**\r\n\r\n41.5% as the unchanged radiolabeled drug\r\n\r\n7.0% as a hydroxylated metabolite\r\n\r\n3.2% as an O-glucuroni",

    "description": "Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), the transporters primarily responsible for the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney.[A203453] It is used clinically as an adjunct to diet and exercise, often in combination with other drug therapies,[L13673,L13679,L11479] for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L13688]\r\n\r\nThe first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the \"flozin\" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]",
    "indication": "Empagliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. It is used either alone or in combination with [metformin] or [linagliptin].[L13679, L13673, L13688, L49449] It is also indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, either alone or as a combination product with metformin.[L13688, L40778]\r\n\r\nAn extended-release combination product containing empagliflozin, metformin, and linagliptin was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used adjunctively with diet and exercise.[L11479]\r\n\r\nEmpagliflozin is also approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure in adult patients with heart failure, either alone or in combination with metformin.[L13688, L45578] It is also indicate",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.[L13688] It has a relatively long duration of action requiring only once-daily dosing. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose level as empagliflozin may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis in the absence of hyperglycemia.[L13688] As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease. \r\n\r\nThe overexcretion of glucose creates a sugar-rich urogenital environment which increases the risk of urogenital infections in both male and female patients - monitor closely for signs and symptoms of developing infection.[L13688]",
    "mechanism_of_action": "The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.[A203453] Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosur",
    "toxicity": "Experience with empagliflozin overdose is limited - employ standard symptomatic and supportive measures, as well as gastric decontamination when appropriate.

    "description": "Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog used to manage type 2 diabetes along with lifestyle changes, such as dietary restrictions and increased physical activity.[A31421,L8681] Other members of this drug class include [Exenatide] and [Liraglutide]. Semaglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk and approved by the FDA for subcutaneous injection in December 2017.[L8681] The tablet formulation was approved for oral administration in September 2019. Semaglutide works by binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor, thereby stimulating insulin secretion and reducing blood glucose.[L8678]\r\n\r\nThe subcutaneous injection is administered once weekly and the tablet is administered once a day. Semaglutide offers a competitive advantage over other drugs used to manage diabetes, which may require several daily doses. Clinical trials have determined that this drug reduces glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and reduces body weight, proving to be effective for patients with type 2 diabetes.[A186053] In June 2021, semaglutide was approved by the FDA for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight who have at least one weight-related condition, marking semaglutide as the first approved drug for such use since 2014.[L34485] The use of semaglutide in weight management is also approved by Health Canada [L39347] and the EMA.[L41335]\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 2023, the FDA issued a warning regarding the use of compounded semaglutide after receiving adverse event reports. The use of salt forms of semaglutide, including semaglutide sodium and semaglutide acetate, has not been proven to be safe or effective.[L46726]",
    "indication": "Semaglutide is always intended to be used with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. It is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L8678,L8681] However, semaglutide is not a suitable first-line drug for diabetes that has not been controlled by diet and exercise. In addition, it has not been studied in patients with pancreatitis.  Semaglutide is not intended for use in patients with type 1 diabetes or to treat diabetic ketoacidosis.[L8678]\r\n\r\nSemaglutide is indicated for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related condition (such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol).[L34475,L41335]. Semaglutide it is also indicated for chronic weight management in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and sex.[L44552]\r\n\r\nSemaglutide is also used to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular ",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Semaglutide reduces HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, and body weight.[A186062] After 12 weeks of treatment, semaglutide decreased fasting and postprandial glucose by increasing insulin production and decreasing glucagon secretion (which is normally associated with increases in blood sugar). Semaglutide also lowers fasting triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol, exerting beneficial effects on cardiovascular health.[A186053,L1067]\r\n\r\nSemaglutide has been shown to cause medullary thyroid cell carcinoma in rodents. While its clinical relevance to humans is unknown, the FDA advises not to administer this drug in those with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma.  Semaglutide also poses a risk of pancreatitis and dehydration. Patients must be adequately hydrated while on semaglutide and are advised to seek medical attention immediately in cases of abdominal pain radiating to the back. Because this drug delays gastric emptying, it is important to monitor for the efficacy or ad",
    "mechanism_of_action": "**Mechanism of glycemic control**\r\n\r\nGLP-1 is a physiological hormone that promotes glycemic control via several different mechanisms, including insulin secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and reducing postprandial glucagon secretion. The homeostasis of glucose is dependent on hormones such as insulin and amylin, which are secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas.  Semaglutide is 94% similar to human GLP-1. Analogs of this hormone such as semaglutide stimulate the synthesis of insulin[A31424] by stimulating pancreatic islet cells and reducing glucagon secretion.[A31424]  They directly bind with selectivity to the GLP-1 receptor, causing various beneficial downstream effects that reduce blood glucose in a glucose-dependent fashion.[L8681] \r\n\r\n**Mechanism of cardiovascular benefit and weight loss**\r\n\r\n In hypercholesterolemia, semaglutide is believed to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis via decreased gut permeability and decreased inflammation.[A186065] Weight loss is believed",
    "toxicity": "Overdoses of up to 4 mg in one ingestion have been reported, with nausea being the most commonly reported symptom. All patients in clinical trials who experienced an overdose recovered fully.[L8693] Appropriate supportive care should be given according and dictated by the patient's condition. Prolonged observation and treatment may be required, as the half-life of this drug is about one week.[L8681] There is no antidote to an overdose with semaglutide.[L8693]",
    "metabolism": "Semaglutide is cleaved at the peptide backbone, followed by β‐oxidation of the fatty acid chain.[A186092] Naturally occurring GLP‐1 is quickly metabolized by dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) and other enzymes, which is ubiquitous in human tissues. Chemical structure modifications render semaglutide less susceptible to enzymatic degradation by gastrointestinal DPP‐4 enzymes.[A186092] It is slowly and extensively metabolized, with about 83% of the administered dose measured in the plasma as unchange",
    "absorption": "The Cmax of semaglutide was 10.9 nmol/L, with AUC of 3123.4 nmol h/L and a Tmax of 56 h in one clinical trial, achieved within 1-3 days.[A31425,L8681] The absolute bioavailability is 89%.[L8681] Steady-state concentration of the oral tablet is achieved in 4-5 weeks.[A186089] Average steady state concentrations of semaglutide are the mean steady state concentrations after dosing at 0.5mg to 1mg range from 16 nmol/L to 30 nmol/L.[L8693]",
    "half_life": "One of the major properties of semaglutide is its long half-life of 168 h.[A31425] The long half-life is attributed to its albumin binding. This lowers the renal clearance and protects semaglutide from metabolic breakdown.[L8678,L8681]",
