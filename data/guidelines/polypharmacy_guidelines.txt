POLYPHARMACY MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
===================================

DEFINITION
----------
Polypharmacy: Use of 5+ medications concurrently
Hyperpolypharmacy: Use of 10+ medications

RISKS OF POLYPHARMACY
---------------------
- Drug-drug interactions
- Adverse drug events
- Falls and fractures
- Cognitive impairment
- Hospitalization
- Non-adherence (complexity)
- Increased costs

DEPRESCRIBING PRINCIPLES
------------------------
1. Review all medications regularly
2. Identify potentially inappropriate medications
3. Assess benefit vs. risk
4. Prioritize medications to discontinue
5. Plan gradual tapering when needed
6. Monitor after changes
7. Involve patient in decisions

HIGH-RISK COMBINATIONS
----------------------
- Warfarin + NSAIDs (bleeding)
- ACE-I + Potassium supplements (hyperkalemia)
- Beta-blockers + Calcium channel blockers (bradycardia)
- Opioids + Benzodiazepines (respiratory depression)
- SSRIs + Triptans (serotonin syndrome)
- Methotrexate + NSAIDs (toxicity)
- Digoxin + Amiodarone (toxicity)

MEDICATIONS TO AVOID IN ELDERLY (Beers Criteria)
------------------------------------------------
- First-generation antihistamines (Diphenhydramine)
- Benzodiazepines (fall risk)
- Muscle relaxants
- Long-acting sulfonylureas
- Certain anticholinergics
- NSAIDs (long-term)

MEDICATION RECONCILIATION
-------------------------
At every transition of care:
1. Obtain complete medication list
2. Include OTC and supplements
3. Compare with prior lists
4. Identify discrepancies
5. Update records
6. Educate patient

ADHERENCE IN POLYPHARMACY
-------------------------
Strategies:
- Pill organizers (essential)
- Medication synchronization
- Combination products
- Medication therapy management
- Caregiver involvement
- Simplify when possible
- Address one barrier at a time
